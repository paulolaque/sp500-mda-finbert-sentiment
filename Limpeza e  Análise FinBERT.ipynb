FOR EXAMPLE, MILDER THAN NORMAL WEATHER CAN REDUCE DEMAND FOR ELECTRICITY AND GAS TRANS\\n\\nMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION SERVICES. IN ADDITION, SEVERE WEATHER, INCLUDING\\n\\nHURRICANES, WINTER STORMS, EARTHQUAKES, FLOODS AND OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS CAN DISRUPT OPERATION OF THE COMPANIES’ FACILITIES AND CAUSE SERVICE OUTAGES, PRODUCTION DELAYS AND PROPERTY DAMAGE THAT REQUIRE INCURRING ADDITIONAL EXPENSES. CHANGES\\n\\nIN WEATHER CONDITIONS CAN RESULT IN REDUCED WATER LEVELS OR CHANGES IN WATER TEMPERATURES THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OPERATIONS AT SOME OF THE COMPANIES’ POWER STATIONS. FURTHERMORE, THE COMPANIES’ OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED\\n\\nAND THEIR PHYSICAL PLANT PLACED AT GREATER RISK OF DAMAGE SHOULD CHANGES IN GLOBAL CLIMATE PRODUCE, AMONG OTHER POSSIBLE CONDITIONS, UNUSUAL VARIATIONS IN TEMPERATURE AND WEATHER PATTERNS, RESULTING IN MORE INTENSE, FREQUENT AND EXTREME WEATHER\\n\\nEVENTS, ABNORMAL LEVELS OF PRECIPITATION AND, FOR OPERATIONS LOCATED ON OR NEAR COASTLINES, A CHANGE IN SEA LEVEL OR SEA TEMPERATURES.\\n\\nTHE RATES OF DOMINION’S AND DOMINION GAS’ GAS TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS AND VIRGINIA POWER’S ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION, DISTRIBUTION AND GENERATION OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO\\n\\nREGULATORY REVIEW.\\n\\nREVENUE PROVIDED BY VIRGINIA POWER’S ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION, DISTRIBUTION AND GENERATION OPERATIONS AND DOMINION’S AND DOMINION GAS’ GAS TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS IS BASED PRIMARILY ON RATES\\n\\nAPPROVED BY STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATORY AGENCIES. THE PROFITABILITY OF THESE BUSINESSES IS DEPENDENT ON THEIR ABILITY, THROUGH THE RATES THAT THEY ARE PERMITTED TO CHARGE, TO RECOVER COSTS AND EARN A REASONABLE RATE OF RETURN ON THEIR CAPITAL\\n\\nINVESTMENT.\\n\\nVIRGINIA POWER’S WHOLESALE RATES FOR ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION SERVICE ARE UPDATED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS THROUGH\\n\\nOPERATION OF A FERC-APPROVED FORMULA RATE MECHANISM. THROUGH THIS MECHANISM, VIRGINIA POWER’S WHOLESALE RATES FOR ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION REFLECT THE ESTIMATED COST OF SERVICE FOR EACH CALENDAR YEAR. THE DIFFERENCE IN THE ESTIMATED COST OF\\n\\nSERVICE AND ACTUAL COST OF SERVICE FOR EACH CALENDAR YEAR IS INCLUDED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE WHOLESALE RATES FOR ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION SERVICE IN A SUBSEQUENT CALENDAR YEAR. THESE WHOLESALE RATES ARE SUBJECT TO FERC REVIEW AND PROSPECTIVE\\n\\nADJUSTMENT IN THE EVENT THAT CUSTOMERS AND/OR INTERESTED STATE COMMISSIONS FILE A COMPLAINT WITH FERC AND ARE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT VIRGINIA POWER’S WHOLESALE REVENUE REQUIREMENT IS NO LONGER JUST AND REASONABLE. THEY ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO\\n\\nRETROACTIVE CORRECTIONS TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FORMULA RATE WAS NOT PROPERLY POPULATED WITH THE ACTUAL COSTS.\\n\\nSIMILARLY,\\n\\nVARIOUS RATES AND CHARGES ASSESSED BY DOMINION’S AND DOMINION GAS’ GAS TRANSMISSION BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY FERC. PURSUANT TO FERC’S FEBRUARY 2014 APPROVAL OF DTI’S UNCONTESTED SETTLEMENT OFFER, DTI’S BASE RATES\\n\\nFOR STORAGE AND TRANSPORTATION SERVICES ARE SUBJECT TO A MORATORIUM THROUGH\\n\\n25\\n\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\n\\nTHE END OF 2016. IN ADDITION, THE RATES OF DOMINION’S AND DOMINION GAS’ GAS DISTRIBUTION BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO STATE REGULATORY REVIEW IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THEY OPERATE. A\\n\\nFAILURE BY US TO SUPPORT THESE RATES COULD RESULT IN RATE DECREASES FROM CURRENT RATE LEVELS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.\\n\\nVIRGINIA POWER’S BASE RATES, TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR GENERATION AND DISTRIBUTION SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN VIRGINIA ARE REVIEWED BY\\n\\nTHE VIRGINIA COMMISSION ON A BIENNIAL BASIS IN A PROCEEDING THAT INVOLVES THE DETERMINATION OF VIRGINIA POWER’S ACTUAL EARNED ROE DURING A COMBINED TWO-YEAR HISTORIC TEST PERIOD, AND THE DETERMINATION OF VIRGINIA POWER’S AUTHORIZED ROE\\n\\nPROSPECTIVELY. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE REGULATION ACT, VIRGINIA POWER MAY BE REQUIRED TO SHARE A PORTION OF ITS EARNINGS WITH CUSTOMERS THROUGH A REFUND PROCESS.\\n\\nLEGISLATION SIGNED BY THE VIRGINIA GOVERNOR IN FEBRUARY 2015 SUSPENDS BIENNIAL REVIEWS FOR THE FIVE SUCCESSIVE 12-MONTH TEST PERIODS\\n\\nBEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2015 AND ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2019, AND NO CHANGES WILL BE MADE TO VIRGINIA POWER’S EXISTING BASE RATES UNTIL AT LEAST DECEMBER 1, 2022. DURING THIS PERIOD, VIRGINIA POWER BEARS THE RISK OF ANY SEVERE WEATHER\\n\\nEVENTS AND NATURAL DISASTERS, THE RISK OF ASSET IMPAIRMENTS RELATED TO THE EARLY RETIREMENT OF ANY GENERATION FACILITIES DUE TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CLEAN POWER PLAN REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN GENERAL OPERATING AND FINANCING COSTS,\\n\\nAND VIRGINIA POWER MAY NOT RECOVER ITS ASSOCIATED COSTS THROUGH INCREASES TO BASE RATES. IF VIRGINIA POWER INCURS ANY SUCH SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL EXPENSES DURING THIS PERIOD, VIRGINIA POWER MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RECOVER ITS COSTS AND/OR EARN A\\n\\nREASONABLE RETURN ON CAPITAL INVESTMENT, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT VIRGINIA POWER’S FUTURE EARNINGS.\\n\\nVIRGINIA\\n\\nPOWER’S RETAIL ELECTRIC BASE RATES FOR BUNDLED GENERATION, TRANSMISSION, AND DISTRIBUTION SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN NORTH CAROLINA ARE REGULATED ON A COST-OF-SERVICE/RATE-OF-RETURN BASIS SUBJECT TO NORTH CAROLINA STATUTES, AND THE RULES AND\\n\\nPROCEDURES OF THE NORTH CAROLINA COMMISSION. IF RETAIL ELECTRIC EARNINGS EXCEED THE RETURNS ESTABLISHED BY THE NORTH CAROLINA COMMISSION, RETAIL ELECTRIC RATES MAY BE SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND POSSIBLE REDUCTION BY THE NORTH CAROLINA COMMISSION, WHICH\\n\\nMAY DECREASE VIRGINIA POWER’S FUTURE EARNINGS. ADDITIONALLY, IF THE NORTH CAROLINA COMMISSION DOES NOT ALLOW RECOVERY THROUGH BASE RATES, ON A TIMELY BASIS, OF COSTS INCURRED IN PROVIDING SERVICE, VIRGINIA POWER’S FUTURE EARNINGS COULD BE\\n\\nNEGATIVELY IMPACTED.\\n\\nGOVERNMENTAL OFFICIALS, STAKEHOLDERS AND ADVOCACY GROUPS MAY CHALLENGE THESE REGULATORY REVIEWS. SUCH\\n\\nCHALLENGES MAY LENGTHEN THE TIME, COMPLEXITY AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH REGULATORY REVIEWS.\\n\\nTHE COMPANIES ARE SUBJECT\\n\\nTO COMPLEX GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION, INCLUDING TAX REGULATION, THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THEIR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND SUBJECT THE COMPANIES TO MONETARY PENALTIES.\\n\\nTHE COMPANIES’ OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE FEDERAL, STATE AND\\n\\nLOCAL REGULATION AND REQUIRE NUMEROUS PERMITS,\\n\\nAPPROVALS AND CERTIFICATES FROM VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES. SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERN THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE SERVICES WE OFFER, OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH AFFILIATES, PROTECTION OF\\n\\nOUR CRITICAL ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE ASSETS AND PIPELINE SAFETY, AMONG OTHER MATTERS. THESE OPERATIONS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO LEGISLATION GOVERNING TAXATION AT THE FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. THEY MUST ALSO COMPLY WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AND\\n\\nASSOCIATED REGULATIONS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE NECESSARY APPROVALS HAVE\\n\\nBEEN OBTAINED FOR EXISTING OPERATIONS AND THAT THE BUSINESS IS CONDUCTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS. THE COMPANIES’ BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY REGIMES WHICH COULD\\n\\nRESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY PENALTIES IF ANY OF THE COMPANIES IS FOUND NOT TO BE IN COMPLIANCE, INCLUDING MANDATORY RELIABILITY STANDARDS AND INTERACTION IN THE WHOLESALE MARKETS. NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS, THE REVISION OR REINTERPRETATION OF\\n\\nEXISTING LAWS OR\\n\\nREGULATIONS, CHANGES IN ENFORCEMENT PRACTICES OF REGULATORS, OR PENALTIES IMPOSED FOR NON-COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING LAWS OR REGULATIONS MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL EXPENSE.\\n\\nDOMINION’S AND VIRGINIA POWER’S GENERATION BUSINESS MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY POSSIBLE FERC ACTIONS THAT COULD CHANGE\\n\\nMARKET DESIGN IN THE WHOLESALE MARKETS OR AFFECT PRICING RULES OR REVENUE CALCULATIONS IN THE RTO MARKETS.\\n\\nDOMINION’S AND VIRGINIA POWER’S GENERATION STATIONS OPERATING IN RTO MARKETS SELL CAPACITY, ENERGY AND ANCILLARY SERVICES INTO\\n\\nWHOLESALE ELECTRICITY MARKETS REGULATED BY FERC. THE WHOLESALE MARKETS ALLOW THESE GENERATION STATIONS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MARKET PRICE OPPORTUNITIES, BUT ALSO EXPOSE THEM TO MARKET RISK. PROPERLY FUNCTIONING COMPETITIVE WHOLESALE MARKETS DEPEND\\n\\nUPON FERC’S CONTINUATION OF CLEARLY IDENTIFIED MARKET RULES. FROM TIME TO TIME\\n\\nFERC MAY INVESTIGATE AND AUTHORIZE RTOS TO MAKE CHANGES IN MARKET DESIGN. FERC ALSO PERIODICALLY REVIEWS DOMINION’S AUTHORITY TO SELL AT MARKET-BASED\\n\\nRATES. MATERIAL CHANGES BY FERC TO THE DESIGN OF THE WHOLESALE MARKETS OR ITS INTERPRETATION OF MARKET RULES, DOMINION’S OR VIRGINIA POWER’S AUTHORITY TO SELL POWER AT MARKET-BASED RATES, OR CHANGES TO PRICING RULES OR RULES INVOLVING\\n\\nREVENUE CALCULATIONS, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE FUTURE RESULTS OF DOMINION’S OR VIRGINIA POWER’S GENERATION BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN JULY 2015, FERC APPROVED CHANGES TO PJM’S RELIABILITY PRICING MODEL CAPACITY MARKET ESTABLISHING A\\n\\nNEW\\n\\nCAPACITY PERFORMANCE RESOURCE PRODUCT. THIS PRODUCT OFFERS THE POTENTIAL FOR HIGHER CAPACITY PRICES BUT CAN ALSO IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC PENALTIES ON GENERATOR OWNERS SUCH AS VIRGINIA POWER FOR FAILURE TO PERFORM DURING PERIODS WHEN\\n\\nELECTRICITY IS IN HIGH DEMAND. IN ADDITION, THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES TO THE INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION OF FERC’S MARKET MANIPULATION\\n\\nRULES. A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE RULES COULD LEAD TO CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES.\\n\\nTHE COMPANIES’ INFRASTRUCTURE BUILD AND EXPANSION PLANS OFTEN REQUIRE REGULATORY APPROVAL BEFORE CONSTRUCTION CAN\\n\\nCOMMENCE. THE COMPANIES MAY NOT COMPLETE FACILITY CONSTRUCTION, PIPELINE, CONVERSION OR OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT THEY COMMENCE, OR THEY MAY COMPLETE PROJECTS ON MATERIALLY DIFFERENT TERMS OR TIMING THAN INITIALLY ANTICIPATED, AND THEY MAY\\n\\nNOT BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE INTENDED BENEFITS OF ANY SUCH PROJECT, IF COMPLETED.\\n\\nSEVERAL FACILITY CONSTRUCTION, PIPELINE, ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION LINE, EXPANSION, CONVERSION AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN ANNOUNCED AND ADDITIONAL\\n\\nPROJECTS MAY BE CONSIDERED IN THE FUTURE. THE COMPANIES COMPETE FOR PROJECTS WITH COMPANIES OF VARYING SIZE AND FINANCIAL CAPABILITIES, INCLUDING SOME THAT MAY HAVE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES. COMMENCING CONSTRUCTION ON ANNOUNCED AND FUTURE PROJECTS MAY\\n\\nREQUIRE APPROVALS FROM APPLICABLE STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES, AND SUCH APPROVALS COULD INCLUDE MITIGATION COSTS WHICH MAY BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANIES. PROJECTS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BE COMPLETED ON TIME AS A RESULT OF WEATHER CONDITIONS, DELAYS IN\\n\\nOBTAINING OR FAILURE TO OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVALS, DELAYS IN OBTAINING KEY MATERIALS, LABOR DIFFICULTIES, DIFFICULTIES WITH PART\\n\\nNERS OR\\n\\n26\\n\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\n\\nPOTENTIAL PARTNERS, A DECLINE IN THE CREDIT STRENGTH OF COUNTERPARTIES OR VENDORS, OR OTHER FACTORS BEYOND THE COMPANIES’ CONTROL. EVEN IF FACILITY CONSTRUCTION, PIPELINE, EXPANSION,\\n\\nELECTRIC TRANSMISSION LINE, CONVERSION AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS ARE COMPLETED, THE TOTAL COSTS OF THE PROJECTS MAY BE HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED AND THE PERFORMANCE OF THE BUSINESS OF THE COMPANIES FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF THE PROJECTS MAY NOT\\n\\nMEET EXPECTATIONS. START-UP AND OPERATIONAL ISSUES CAN ARISE IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMMENCEMENT OF COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS AT OUR FACILITIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO COMMENCEMENT OF COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS AT OUR POWER GENERATION FACILITIES\\n\\nFOLLOWING EXPANSIONS AND FUEL TYPE CONVERSIONS TO NATURAL GAS AND BIOMASS. SUCH ISSUES MAY INCLUDE FAILURE TO MEET SPECIFIC OPERATING PARAMETERS, WHICH MAY REQUIRE ADJUSTMENTS TO MEET OR AMEND THESE OPERATING PARAMETERS. ADDITIONALLY, THE\\n\\nCOMPANIES MAY NOT BE ABLE TO TIMELY AND EFFEC\\n\\nTIVELY INTEGRATE THE PROJECTS INTO THEIR OPERATIONS AND SUCH INTEGRATION MAY RESULT IN UNFORESEEN OPERATING DIFFICULTIES OR UNANTICIPATED COSTS. FURTHER, REGULATORS MAY DISALLOW RECOVERY OF SOME OF\\n\\nTHE COSTS OF A PROJECT IF THEY ARE DEEMED NOT TO BE PRUDENTLY INCURRED. ANY OF THESE OR OTHER FACTORS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANIES’ ABILITY TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS FROM THE FACILITY CONSTRUCTION, PIPELINE, ELECTRIC\\n\\nTRANSMISSION LINE, EXPANSION, CONVERSION AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS.\\n\\nTHE DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION OF\\n\\nSEVERAL LARGE-SCALE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS SIMULTANEOUSLY INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT EXECUTION RISK.\\n\\nTHE COMPANIES ARE CURRENTLY SIMULTANEOUSLY DEVELOPING OR CONSTRUCTING SEVERAL MAJOR PROJECTS, INCLUDING THE LIQUEFACTION PROJECT, THE ATLANTIC COAST\\n\\nPIPELINE PROJECT, THE SUPPLY HEADER PROJECT, GREENSVILLE COUNTY, BRUNSWICK COUNTY, AND MULTIPLE DTI PRODUCER OUTLET PROJECTS, WHICH TOGETHER HELP CONTRIBUTE TO THE OVER $23  IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES PLANNED BY THE COMPANIES THROUGH 2020.\\n\\nSEVERAL OF THE COMPANIES’ KEY PROJECTS ARE INCREASINGLY LARGE-SCALE, COMPLEX AND BEING CONSTRUCTED IN CONSTRAINED GEOGRAPHIC AREAS (FOR EXAMPLE, THE LIQUEFACTION PROJECT) OR IN DIFFICULT TERRAIN (FOR EXAMPLE, THE ATLANTIC COAST PIPELINE\\n\\nPROJECT). THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE COMPANIES’ VENTURES IS ALSO AFFECTED BY THE INTERVENTIONS, LITIGATION OR OTHER ACTIVITIES OF STAKEHOLDER AND ADVOCACY GROUPS, SOME OF WHICH OPPOSE NATURAL GAS-RELATED AND ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. FOR\\n\\nEXAMPLE, CERTAIN LANDOWNERS AND STAKEHOLDER GROUPS OPPOSE THE ATLANTIC COAST PIPELINE, WHICH COULD IMPEDE THE ACQUISITION OF RIGHTS-OF-WAY AND OTHER LAND RIGHTS ON A TIMELY BASIS OR ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS. GIVEN THAT THESE PROJECTS PROVIDE THE\\n\\nFOUNDATION FOR THE COMPANIES’ STRATEGIC GROWTH PLAN, IF THE COMPANIES ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN OR MAINTAIN THE REQUIRED APPROVALS, DEVELOP THE NECESSARY TECHNICAL EXPERTISE, ALLOCATE AND COORDINATE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES, ADHERE TO BUDGETS AND\\n\\nTIMELINES, EFFECTIVELY HANDLE PUBLIC OUTREACH EFFORTS, OR OTHERWISE FAIL TO SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTE THE PROJECTS, THERE COULD BE AN ADVERSE IMPACT TO THE COMPANIES’ FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. FOR EXAMPLE, WHILE\\n\\nDOMINION HAS RECEIVED THE REQUIRED APPROVALS TO COMMENCE CONSTRUCTION OF THE LIQUEFACTION PROJECT FROM THE DOE, ALL DOE EXPORT LICENSES ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND POSSIBLE WITHDRAWAL SHOULD THE DOE CONCLUDE THAT SUCH EXPORT AUTHORIZATION IS NO LONGER\\n\\nIN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH REGULATORY APPROVAL CONDITIONS OR AN ADVERSE RULING IN ANY FUTURE LITIGATION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANIES’ ABILITY TO EXECUTE ITS BUSINESS PLAN.\\n\\nTHE COMPANIES ARE DEPENDENT ON THEIR CONTRACTORS FOR THE SUCCESSFUL AND TIMELY COMPLETION\\n\\nOF LARGE-SCALE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. THE CONSTRUCTION OF SUCH PROJECTS IS EXPECTED TO TAKE SEVERAL YEARS, IS TYPICALLY CONFINED WITHIN A LIMITED GEOGRAPHIC AREA OR DIFFICULT TERRAIN AND COULD BE SUBJECT TO DELAYS, COST OVERRUNS, LABOR DISPUTES\\n\\nAND OTHER FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE THE TOTAL COST OF THE PROJECT TO EXCEED THE ANTICIPATED AMOUNT AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANIES’ FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND/OR IMPAIR THE COMPANIES’ ABILITY TO EXECUTE THE BUSINESS PLAN FOR THE PROJECT\\n\\nAS SCHEDULED.\\n\\nFURTHER, AN INABILITY TO OBTAIN FINANCING OR OTHERWISE PROVIDE LIQUIDITY FOR THE PROJECTS ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS\\n\\nCOULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMPANIES’ FINANCIAL CONDITION, CASH FLOWS, THE PROJECTS’ ANTICIPATED FINANCIAL RESULTS AND/OR IMPAIR THE COMPANIES’ ABILITY TO EXECUTE THE BUSINESS PLAN FOR THE PROJECTS AS SCHEDULED.\\n\\nANY ADDITIONAL FEDERAL AND/OR STATE REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED ON ENERGY COMPANIES MANDATING LIMITATIONS ON GHG\\n\\nEMISSIONS OR REQUIRING EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS MAY RESULT IN COMPLIANCE COSTS THAT ALONE OR IN COMBINATION COULD MAKE SOME OF THE COMPANIES’ ELECTRIC GENERATION UNITS OR NATURAL GAS FACILITIES UNECONOMICAL TO MAINTAIN OR OPERATE.\\n\\nTHE CLEAN\\n\\nPOWER PLAN IS TARGETED AT REDUCING CO\\n\\n2\\n\\nEMISSIONS FROM\\n\\nEXISTING FOSSIL FUEL-FIRED POWER GENERATION FACILITIES.\\n\\nCOMPLIANCE WITH THE CLEAN POWER PLAN MAY REQUIRE INCREASING THE\\n\\nENERGY EFFICIENCY OF EQUIPMENT AT FACILITIES, COMMITTING SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL TOWARD CARBON REDUCTION PROGRAMS, PURCHASE OF ALLOWANCES AND/OR EMISSION RATE CREDITS, FUEL SWITCHING, AND/OR RETIREMENT OF HIGH-EMITTING GENERATION FACILITIES AND\\n\\nPOTENTIAL REPLACEMENT WITH LOWER EMITTING GENERATION FACILITIES. THE CLEAN POWER PLAN USES A SET OF MEASURES FOR REDUCING EMISSIONS FROM EXISTING SOURCES THAT INCLUDES EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS AT COAL PLANTS, DISPLACING COAL-FIRED GENERATION WITH\\n\\nINCREASED UTILIZATION OF NATURAL GAS COMBINED CYCLE UNITS, AND EXPANDING RENEWABLE RESOURCES. COMPLIANCE WITH THE CLEAN POWER PLAN’S ANTICIPATED IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS MAY REQUIRE VIRGINIA POWER TO PREMATURELY RETIRE CERTAIN GENERATING\\n\\nFACILITIES, WITH THE POTENTIAL LACK OR DELAY OF COST RECOVERY AND HIGHER ELECTRIC RATES, WHICH COULD AFFECT CONSUMER DEMAND. THE COST OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE CLEAN POWER PLAN IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTIES DUE TO THE OUTCOME OF SEVERAL\\n\\nINTERRELATED ASSUMPTIONS AND VARIABLES, INCLUDING TIMING OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF RULES, REQUIRED LEVELS OF REDUCTIONS, ALLOCATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE NEW RULES, THE MATURATION AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF CARBON CONTROLS AND/OR REDUCTION PROGRAMS, AND\\n\\nTHE SELECTED COMPLIANCE ALTERNATIVES. DOMINION AND VIRGINIA POWER CANNOT ESTIMATE THE AGGREGATE EFFECT OF SUCH REQUIREMENTS ON THEIR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR THEIR CUSTOMERS. HOWEVER, SUCH EXPENDITURES, IF MATERIAL, COULD MAKE\\n\\nDOMINION’S AND VIRGINIA POWER’S GENERATION FACILITIES UNECONOMICAL TO OPERATE, RESULT IN THE IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS, OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT DOMINION’S OR VIRGINIA POWER’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR\\n\\nLIQUIDITY.\\n\\nTHERE ARE ALSO POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON DOMINION’S AND DOMINION GAS’ NATURAL GAS BUSINESSES AS FEDERAL OR\\n\\nSTATE GHG REGULATIONS MAY REQUIRE GHG EMISSION REDUCTIONS FROM THE NATURAL GAS SECTOR AND COULD AFFECT DEMAND FOR NATURAL GAS. ADDITIONALLY, GHG REQUIREMENTS COULD RESULT IN INCREASED DEMAND FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION AND RENEWABLE PRODUCTS, WHICH\\n\\nCOULD IMPACT THE NATURAL GAS BUSINESSES.\\n\\n27\\n\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\n\\nTHE COMPANIES’ OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND\\n\\nREGULATIONS WHICH IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT COMPLIANCE COSTS TO THE COMPANIES.\\n\\nTHE COMPANIES’ OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL STATUTES, RULES AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO AIR QUALITY, WATER QUALITY, WASTE\\n\\nMANAGEMENT, NATURAL RESOURCES, AND HEALTH AND SAFETY. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS REQUIRES THE COMPANIES TO COMMIT SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL TOWARD PERMITTING, EMISSION FEES, ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING, INSTALLATION AND OPERATION OF\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL EQUIPMENT AND PURCHASE OF ALLOWANCES AND/OR\\n\\nOFFSETS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANIES COULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR\\n\\nEXPENSES RELATING TO REMEDIATION AND CONTAINMENT OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING AT SITES WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN\\n\\nIDENTIFIED BY A REGULATORY\\n\\nAGENCY AS A POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTY. EXPENDITURES RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT IN THE PAST, AND\\n\\nTHE COMPANIES EXPECT THAT THEY WILL REMAIN SIGNIFICANT IN THE FUTURE.\\n\\nCERTAIN FACILITIES HAVE BECOME UNECONOMICAL TO OPERATE AND HAVE BEEN SHUT DOWN, CONVERTED TO NEW FUEL TYPES OR SOLD. THESE TYPES OF EVENTS COULD OCCUR AGAIN IN THE FUTURE.\\n\\nEXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY BE REVISED AND/OR NEW LAWS MAY BE ADOPTED OR BECOME APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANIES. RISKS\\n\\nRELATING TO EXPECTED REGULATION OF GHG EMISSIONS FROM EXISTING FOSSIL FUEL-FIRED ELECTRIC GENERATING UNITS ARE DISCUSSED ABOVE. IN ADDITION, FURTHER REGULATION OF AIR QUALITY AND GHG EMISSIONS UNDER THE CAA WILL BE IMPOSED ON THE NATURAL GAS SECTOR,\\n\\nINCLUDING RULES TO LIMIT METHANE LEAKAGE. THE COMPANIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO RECENTLY FINALIZED FEDERAL WATER AND WASTE REGULATIONS, INCLUDING REGULATIONS CONCERNING COOLING WATER INTAKE STRUCTURES, COAL COMBUSTION BY-PRODUCT HANDLING AND DISPOSAL\\n\\nPRACTICES, WASTEWATER DISCHARGES FROM STEAM ELECTRIC GENERATING STATIONS AND THE POTENTIAL FURTHER REGULATION OF POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS.\\n\\nCOMPLIANCE COSTS CANNOT BE ESTIMATED WITH CERTAINTY DUE TO THE INABILITY TO PREDICT THE REQUIREMENTS AND TIMING OF IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY NEW ENVIRONMENTAL RULES OR REGULATIONS. OTHER FACTORS WHICH AFFECT\\n\\nTHE ABILITY TO PREDICT FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES WITH CERTAINTY INCLUDE THE DIFFICULTY IN ESTIMATING CLEAN-UP COSTS AND QUANTIFYING LIABILITIES UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS THAT IMPOSE JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY ON ALL RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.\\n\\nHOWEVER, SUCH EXPENDITURES, IF MATERIAL, COULD MAKE THE COMPANIES’ FACILITIES UNECONOMICAL TO OPERATE, RESULT IN THE IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS, OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANIES’ RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR\\n\\nLIQUIDITY.\\n\\nVIRGINIA POWER IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DISPOSAL AND STORAGE OF COAL ASH.\\n\\nVIRGINIA POWER\\n\\nHISTORICALLY PRODUCED AND CONTINUES TO PRODUCE COAL ASH, OR CCRS, AS A BY-PRODUCT OF ITS COAL-FIRED GENERATION OPERATIONS. THE ASH IS STORED AND MANAGED IN IMPOUNDMENTS (ASH PONDS) AND LANDFILLS LOCATED AT EIGHT DIFFERENT FACILITIES.\\n\\nVIRGINIA POWER MAY FACE LITIGATION REGARDING ALLEGED CWA VIOLATIONS AT POSSUM POINT, AND IS FACING LITIGATION REGARDING\\n\\nALLEGED CWA VIOLATIONS AT CHESAPEAKE AND COULD INCUR SETTLEMENT EXPENSES AND OTHER COSTS, DEPENDING ON THE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH LITIGATION, INCLUDING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH CLOSING, CORRECTIVE ACTION AND ONGOING MONITORING OF CERTAIN ASH PONDS. IN\\n\\nADDITION, THE EPA AND VIRGINIA RECENTLY ISSUED REGULATIONS CONCERNING THE MANAGEMENT AND STORAGE OF CCRS AND WEST VIRGINIA MAY IMPOSE ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS THAT WILL APPLY TO THE FACILITIES NOTED ABOVE. THESE REGULATIONS WILL REQUIRE VIRGINIA POWER\\n\\nTO MAKE ADDITIONAL\\n\\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INCREASE ITS OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSES.\\n\\nFURTHER, WHILE VIRGINIA POWER OPERATES ITS ASH PONDS AND LANDFILLS IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE STATE SAFETY REGULATIONS, A RELEASE OF\\n\\nCOAL ASH WITH A SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT, SUCH AS THE DAN RIVER ASH BASIN RELEASE BY A NEIGHBORING UTILITY, COULD RESULT IN REMEDIATION COSTS, CIVIL AND/OR CRIMINAL PENALTIES, CLAIMS, LITIGATION, INCREASED REGULATION AND COMPLIANCE COSTS,\\n\\nAND REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE, AND COULD IMPACT THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF VIRGINIA POWER.\\n\\nTHE COMPANIES’ OPERATIONS ARE\\n\\nSUBJECT TO OPERATIONAL HAZARDS, EQUIPMENT FAILURES, SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS AND PERSONNEL ISSUES WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMPANIES.\\n\\nOPERATION OF THE COMPANIES’ FACILITIES INVOLVES RISK, INCLUDING THE RISK OF POTENTIAL BREAKDOWN\\n\\nOR FAILURE OF EQUIPMENT OR PROCESSES DUE TO AGING INFRASTRUCTURE, FUEL SUPPLY, PIPELINE INTEGRITY OR TRANSPORTATION DISRUPTIONS, ACCIDENTS, LABOR DISPUTES OR WORK STOPPAGES BY EMPLOYEES, ACTS OF TERRORISM OR SABOTAGE, CONSTRUCTION DELAYS OR COST\\n\\nOVERRUNS, SHORTAGES OF OR DELAYS IN OBTAINING EQUIPMENT, MATERIAL AND LABOR, OPERATIONAL RESTRICTIONS RESULTING FROM ENVIRONMENTAL LIMITATIONS AND GOVERNMENTAL INTERVENTIONS, AND PERFORMANCE BELOW EXPECTED LEVELS. THE COMPANIES’ BUSINESSES ARE\\n\\nDEPENDENT UPON SOPHISTICATED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE, THE FAILURE OF WHICH COULD PREVENT THEM FROM ACCOMPLISHING CRITICAL BUSINESS FUNCTIONS. BECAUSE THE COMPANIES’ TRANSMISSION FACILITIES, PIPELINES AND OTHER\\n\\nFACILITIES ARE INTERCONNECTED WITH THOSE OF THIRD PARTIES, THE OPERATION OF THEIR FACILITIES AND PIPELINES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY UNEXPECTED OR UNCONTROLLABLE EVENTS OCCURRING ON THE SYSTEMS OF SUCH THIRD PARTIES.\\n\\nOPERATION OF THE COMPANIES’ FACILITIES BELOW EXPECTED CAPACITY LEVELS COULD RESULT IN LOST REVENUES AND INCREASED EXPENSES, INCLUDING\\n\\nHIGHER MAINTENANCE COSTS. UNPLANNED OUTAGES OF THE COMPANIES’ FACILITIES AND EXTENSIONS OF SCHEDULED OUTAGES DUE TO MECHANICAL FAILURES OR OTHER PROBLEMS OCCUR FROM TIME TO TIME AND ARE AN INHERENT RISK OF THE COMPANIES’ BUSINESS.\\n\\nUNPLANNED OUTAGES TYPICALLY INCREASE THE COMPANIES’ OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSES AND MAY REDUCE THEIR REVENUES AS A RESULT OF SELLING LESS OUTPUT OR MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANIES TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS AS A RESULT OF OPERATING HIGHER COST\\n\\nUNITS OR OBTAINING REPLACEMENT OUTPUT FROM THIRD PARTIES IN THE OPEN MARKET TO SATISFY FORWARD ENERGY AND CAPACITY OR OTHER CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. MOREOVER, IF THE COMPANIES ARE UNABLE TO PERFORM THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, PENALTIES OR\\n\\nLIABILITY FOR DAMAGES COULD RESULT.\\n\\nIN ADDITION, THERE ARE MANY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANIES’ OPERATIONS AND THE\\n\\nTRANSPORTATION, STORAGE AND PROCESSING OF NATURAL GAS AND NGLS, INCLUDING NUCLEAR ACCIDENTS, FIRES, EXPLOSIONS, UNCONTROLLED RELEASE OF NATURAL GAS AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS, POLE STRIKES, ELECTRIC CONTACT CASES, THE COLLISION OF THIRD PARTY\\n\\nEQUIPMENT WITH PIPELINES AND AVIAN AND OTHER WILDLIFE IMPACTS. SUCH INCIDENTS COULD RESULT IN LOSS OF HUMAN LIFE OR INJURIES AMONG EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS OR THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL, ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION, DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION OF FACILITIES OR\\n\\nBUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS AND ASSOCIATED PUBLIC OR EMPLOYEE SAFETY IMPACTS, LOSS OF REVENUES, INCREASED LIABILITIES, HEIGHTENED REGULATORY SCRUTINY AND REPUTATIONAL RISK. FURTHER, THE LOCATION OF PIPELINES AND STORAGE FACILITIES, OR GENERATION,\\n\\nTRANSMISSION, SUBSTATIONS AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES NEAR POPULATED\\n\\n28\\n\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\n\\nAREAS, INCLUDING RESIDENTIAL AREAS, COMMERCIAL BUSINESS CENTERS AND INDUSTRIAL SITES, COULD INCREASE THE LEVEL OF DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THESE RISKS.\\n\\nDOMINION AND VIRGINIA POWER HAVE SUBSTANTIAL OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN AND OPERATE NUCLEAR GENERATING UNITS; AS A RESULT, EACH MAY INCUR\\n\\nSUBSTANTIAL COSTS AND LIABILITIES.\\n\\nDOMINION’S AND VIRGINIA POWER’S NUCLEAR FACILITIES ARE SUBJECT TO OPERATIONAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND FINANCIAL RISKS SUCH AS THE ON-SITE STORAGE OF SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL, THE ABILITY TO DISPOSE OF\\n\\nSUCH SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL, THE ABILITY TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE RESERVES FOR DECOMMISSION\\n\\nING, LIMITATIONS ON THE AMOUNTS AND TYPES OF INSURANCE AVAILABLE,\\n\\nPOTENTIAL OPERATIONAL LIABILITIES AND EXTENDED OUTAGES, THE COSTS OF\\n\\nREPLACEMENT POWER, THE COSTS OF MAINTENANCE AND THE COSTS OF\\n\\nSECURING THE FACILITIES AGAINST POSSIBLE TERRORIST ATTACKS. DOMINION AND VIRGINIA POWER MAINTAIN DECOMMISSIONING TRUSTS AND EXTERNAL INSURANCE COVERAGE TO MINIMIZE THE FINANCIAL\\n\\nEXPOSURE TO THESE RISKS; HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT FUTURE DECOMMISSIONING\\n\\nCOSTS COULD EXCEED AMOUNTS IN THE DECOMMISSIONING TRUSTS AND/OR DAMAGES COULD EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF INSURANCE COVERAGE. IF DOMINION’S AND VIRGINIA POWER’S\\n\\nDECOMMISSIONING TRUST FUNDS ARE INSUFFICIENT, AND THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO RECOVER THE ADDITIONAL COSTS INCURRED THROUGH INSURANCE, OR IN THE CASE OF VIRGINIA POWER THROUGH REGULATORY MECHANISMS, THEIR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE NEGATIVELY\\n\\nIMPACTED.\\n\\nDOMINION’S AND VIRGINIA POWER’S NUCLEAR FACILITIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO COMPLEX GOVERNMENT\\n\\nREGULATION WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THEIR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE NRC HAS BROAD AUTHORITY UNDER FEDERAL LAW TO IMPOSE LICENSING AND SAFETY-RELATED REQUIREMENTS FOR THE OPERATION OF NUCLEAR GENERATING FACILITIES. IN THE EVENT OF\\n\\nNONCOMPLIANCE, THE NRC HAS THE AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE FINES, SET LICENSE CONDITIONS, SHUT DOWN A NUCLEAR UNIT, OR TAKE SOME COMBINATION OF THESE ACTIONS, DEPENDING ON ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE SEVERITY OF THE SITUATION, UNTIL COMPLIANCE IS ACHIEVED.\\n\\nREVISED SAFETY REQUIREMENTS PROMULGATED BY THE NRC COULD REQUIRE DOMINION AND VIRGINIA POWER TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL EXPENDITURES AT THEIR NUCLEAR PLANTS. IN ADDITION, ALTHOUGH THE COMPANIES HAVE NO REASON TO ANTICIPATE A SERIOUS NUCLEAR INCIDENT AT\\n\\nTHEIR PLANTS, IF AN INCIDENT DID OCCUR, IT COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THEIR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND/OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. A MAJOR INCIDENT AT A NUCLEAR FACILITY ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, SUCH AS THE NUCLEAR EVENTS IN JAPAN IN 2011, COULD\\n\\nCAUSE THE NRC TO ADOPT INCREASED SAFETY REGULATIONS OR OTHERWISE LIMIT OR RESTRICT THE OPERATION OR LICENSING OF DOMESTIC NUCLEAR UNITS.\\n\\nSUSTAINED DECLINES IN NATURAL GAS AND NGL PRICES HAVE RESULTED IN, AND COULD RESULT IN FURTHER, CURTAILMENTS OF THIRD-PARTY PRODUCERS’ DRILLING PROGRAMS, DELAYING THE PRODUCTION OF VOLUMES OF\\n\\nNATURAL GAS AND NGLS THAT DOMINION AND DOMINION GAS GATHER, PROCESS, AND TRANSPORT AND REDUCING THE VALUE OF NGLS RETAINED BY DOMINION GAS, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT DOMINION AND DOMINION GAS’ REVENUES AND EARNINGS.\\n\\nDOMINION AND DOMINION\\n\\nGAS OBTAIN THEIR SUPPLY OF NATURAL GAS AND NGLS FROM NUMEROUS THIRD-PARTY PRODUCERS. MOST PRODUCERS ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO DELIVER A SPECIFIC QUANTITY OF NATURAL GAS OR NGLS TO DOMINION’S AND DOMINION GAS’ FACILITIES. A NUMBER OF OTHER\\n\\nFACTORS COULD REDUCE THE VOLUMES OF NATURAL GAS AND NGLS AVAILABLE TO DOMINION’S AND DOMINION GAS’ PIPELINES AND OTHER ASSETS. INCREASED REGULATION OF ENERGY EXTRACTION ACTIVITIES COULD RESULT IN REDUCTIONS IN DRILLING FOR NEW NATURAL GAS\\n\\nWELLS, WHICH COULD DECREASE THE VOLUMES OF NATURAL GAS SUPPLIED TO DOMINION\\n\\nAND DOMINION GAS. PRODUCERS WITH DIRECT COMMODITY PRICE EXPOSURE FACE LIQUIDITY CONSTRAINTS, WHICH COULD PRESENT A CREDIT RISK TO DOMINION AND DOMINION GAS. PRODUCERS COULD SHIFT THEIR PRODUCTION\\n\\nACTIVITIES TO REGIONS OUTSIDE DOMINION’S AND DOMINION GAS’ FOOTPRINT. IN ADDITION, THE EXTENT OF NATURAL GAS RESERVES AND THE RATE OF PRODUCTION FROM SUCH RESERVES MAY BE LESS THAN ANTICIPATED. IF PRODUCERS WERE TO DECREASE THE SUPPLY OF\\n\\nNATURAL GAS OR NGLS TO DOMINION’S AND DOMINION GAS’ SYSTEMS AND FACILITIES FOR ANY REASON, DOMINION AND DOMINION GAS COULD EXPERIENCE LOWER REVENUES TO THE EXTENT THEY ARE UNABLE TO REPLACE THE LOST VOLUMES ON SIMILAR TERMS. IN ADDITION,\\n\\nDOMINION GAS’ REVENUE FROM PROCESSING AND FRACTIONATION OPERATIONS LARGELY RESULTS FROM THE SALE OF COMMODITIES AT MARKET PRICES. DOMINION GAS RECEIVES THE WET GAS PRODUCT FROM PRODUCERS AND MAY RETAIN THE EXTRACTED NGLS AS COMPENSATION\\n\\nFOR ITS SERVICES. THIS EXPOSES DOMINION GAS TO COMMODITY PRICE RISK FOR THE VALUE OF THE SPREAD BETWEEN THE NGL PRODUCTS AND NATURAL GAS, AND RELATIVE CHANGES IN THESE PRICES COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT DOMINION GAS’ RESULTS.\\n\\nDOMINION’S MERCHANT POWER BUSINESS OPERATES IN A CHALLENGING MARKET, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND\\n\\nFUTURE GROWTH.\\n\\nTHE SUCCESS OF DOMINION’S MERCHANT POWER\\n\\nBUSINESS DEPENDS UPON FAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO SELL POWER AT PRICES SUFFICIENT TO COVER ITS OPERATING COSTS. DOMINION OPERATES IN ACTIVE WHOLESALE\\n\\nMARKETS THAT EXPOSE IT TO PRICE VOLATILITY FOR ELECTRICITY AND FUEL AS WELL AS THE CREDIT RISK OF COUNTERPARTIES. DOMINION ATTEMPTS TO MANAGE ITS PRICE RISK BY ENTERING INTO HEDGING TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM FIXED PRICE SALES\\n\\nAND PURCHASE CONTRACTS.\\n\\nIN THESE WHOLESALE MARKETS, THE SPOT MARKET PRICE OF ELECTRICITY FOR EACH HOUR IS GENERALLY\\n\\nDETERMINED BY THE COST OF SUPPLYING THE NEXT UNIT OF ELECTRICITY TO THE MARKET DURING THAT HOUR. IN MANY CASES, THE NEXT UNIT OF ELECTRICITY SUPPLIED WOULD BE PROVIDED BY GENERATING STATIONS THAT CONSUME FOSSIL FUELS, PRIMARILY NATURAL GAS.\\n\\nCONSEQUENTLY, THE OPEN MARKET WHOLESALE PRICE FOR ELECTRICITY GENERALLY REFLECTS THE COST OF NATURAL GAS PLUS THE COST TO CONVERT THE FUEL TO ELECTRICITY. THEREFORE, CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF NATURAL GAS GENERALLY AFFECT THE OPEN MARKET WHOLESALE\\n\\nPRICE OF ELECTRICITY. TO THE EXTENT DOMINION DOES NOT ENTER INTO LONG-TERM POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENTS OR OTHERWISE EFFECTIVELY HEDGE ITS OUTPUT, THESE CHANGES IN MARKET PRICES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS FINANCIAL RESULTS.\\n\\nDOMINION PURCHASES FUEL UNDER A VARIETY OF TERMS, INCLUDING LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM CONTRACTS AND SPOT MARKET PURCHASES. DOMINION IS\\n\\nEXPOSED TO FUEL COST VOLATILITY FOR THE PORTION OF ITS FUEL OBTAINED THROUGH SHORT-TERM CONTRACTS OR ON THE SPOT MARKET, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF MARKET SUPPLY SHORTAGES. FUEL PRICES CAN BE VOLATILE AND THE PRICE THAT CAN BE OBTAINED FOR POWER\\n\\nPRODUCED FROM SUCH FUEL MAY NOT CHANGE AT THE SAME RATE AS FUEL COSTS, THUS ADVERSELY IMPACTING DOMINION’S FINANCIAL RESULTS.\\n\\nIN ADDITION, IN THE EVENT THAT ANY OF THE MERCHANT GENERATION FACILITIES EXPERIENCE A FORCED OUTAGE, DOMINION MAY NOT RECEIVE THE LEVEL OF REVENUE IT ANTICIPATED.\\n\\nTHE COMPANIES’ FINANCIAL RESULTS CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY VARIOUS FACTORS DRIVING DEMAND FOR ELECTRICITY AND GAS AND RELATED\\n\\nSERVICES.\\n\\nTECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAWS MANDATE NEW LEVELS OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN END-USE DEVICES,\\n\\nINCLUDING LIGHTING, FURNACES AND ELECTRIC HEAT PUMPS AND COULD\\n\\nLEAD TO DECLINES IN PER CAPITA ENERGY CONSUMPTION.\\n\\nADDITIONALLY, CERTAIN REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE BODIES HAVE INTRODUCED OR ARE\\n\\n29\\n\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\n\\nCONSIDERING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR INCENTIVES TO REDUCE ENERGY CONSUMPTION BY A FIXED DATE. FURTHER, VIRGINIA POWER’S BUSINESS MODEL IS PREMISED UPON THE COST EFFICIENCY OF THE PRODUCTION,\\n\\nTRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION OF LARGE-SCALE CENTRALIZED UTILITY GENERATION. HOWEVER, ADVANCES IN DISTRIBUTED GENERATION TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS SOLAR CELLS, GAS MICROTURBINES AND FUEL CELLS, MAY\\n\\nMAKE THESE ALTERNATIVE GENERATION METHODS\\n\\nCOMPETITIVE WITH LARGE-SCALE UTILITY GENERATION, AND CHANGE HOW CUSTOMERS ACQUIRE OR USE OUR SERVICES.\\n\\nREDUCED ENERGY\\n\\nDEMAND OR SIGNIFICANTLY SLOWED GROWTH IN DEMAND DUE TO CUSTOMER ADOPTION OF ENERGY EFFICIENT TECHNOLOGY, CONSERVATION, DISTRIBUTED GENERATION, REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, OR THE IMPACT OF ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS, UNLESS SUBSTANTIALLY\\n\\nOFFSET THROUGH REGULATORY COST ALLOCATIONS, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE VALUE OF THE COMPANIES’ BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.\\n\\nDOMINION GAS HAS EXPERIENCED A DECLINE IN DEMAND FOR CERTAIN OF ITS PROCESSING SERVICES DUE TO COMPETING FACILITIES OPERATING IN NEARBY\\n\\nAREAS.\\n\\nDOMINION GAS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN, RENEW OR REPLACE ITS EXISTING PORTFOLIO OF CUSTOMER CONTRACTS\\n\\nSUCCESSFULLY, OR ON FAVORABLE TERMS.\\n\\nUPON CONTRACT EXPIRATION, CUSTOMERS MAY\\n\\nNOT ELECT TO RE-CONTRACT WITH DOMINION GAS AS A RESULT OF A VARIETY\\n\\nOF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE AMOUNT OF COMPETITION IN THE INDUSTRY, CHANGES IN THE PRICE\\n\\nOF NATURAL GAS, THEIR LEVEL OF SATISFACTION WITH DOMINION GAS’ SERVICES, THE EXTENT TO WHICH DOMINION GAS IS ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTE ITS BUSINESS PLANS AND THE EFFECT OF THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK ON CUSTOMER DEMAND. THE FAILURE TO REPLACE\\n\\nANY SUCH CUSTOMER CONTRACTS ON SIMILAR TERMS COULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF REVENUE FOR DOMINION GAS.\\n\\nCERTAIN OF DOMINION\\n\\nAND DOMINION GAS’ GAS PIPELINE SERVICES ARE SUBJECT TO LONG-TERM, FIXED-PRICE “NEGOTIATED RATE” CONTRACTS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT, EVEN IF THE COST TO PERFORM SUCH SERVICES EXCEEDS THE REVENUES RECEIVED FROM SUCH\\n\\nCONTRACTS.\\n\\nUNDER FERC POLICY, A REGULATED SERVICE PROVIDER AND A CUSTOMER MAY MUTUALLY AGREE TO SIGN A CONTRACT FOR SERVICE AT A “NEGOTIATED RATE” WHICH MAY BE ABOVE OR BELOW THE FERC REGULATED, COST-BASED RECOURSE RATE FOR THAT\\n\\nSERVICE. THESE “NEGOTIATED RATE” CONTRACTS ARE NOT GENERALLY SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT FOR INCREASED COSTS WHICH COULD BE PRODUCED BY INFLATION OR OTHER FACTORS RELATING TO THE SPECIFIC FACILITIES BEING USED TO PERFORM THE SERVICES. ANY\\n\\nSHORTFALL OF REVENUE AS RESULT OF THESE “NEGOTIATED RATE” CONTRACTS COULD DECREASE DOMINION AND DOMINION GAS’ EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS.\\n\\nEXPOSURE TO COUNTERPARTY PERFORMANCE MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANIES’ FINANCIAL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\\n\\nTHE COMPANIES ARE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISKS OF THEIR COUNTERPARTIES AND THE RISK THAT\\n\\nONE OR MORE COUNTERPARTIES MAY FAIL OR DELAY THE PERFORMANCE OF THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PAYMENT FOR SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, SOME OF DOMINION’S OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED THROUGH LESS THAN WHOLLY-OWNED\\n\\nSUBSIDIARIES, SUCH AS FOUR BROTHERS AND THREE CEDARS. IN SUCH ARRANGEMENTS, DOMINION IS DEPENDENT ON THIRD PARTIES TO FUND THEIR REQUIRED SHARE OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. COUNTERPARTIES COULD FAIL OR DELAY THE\\n\\nPERFORM\\n\\nANCE OF THEIR\\n\\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS, INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF REGULATIONS ON THEIR OPERATIONS. DEFAULTS OR FAILURE TO PERFORM BY CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS, JOINT VENTURE PARTNERS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANIES’\\n\\nFINANCIAL RESULTS.\\n\\nDOMINION WILL ALSO BE EXPOSED TO COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK RELATING TO THE TERMINAL SERVICES\\n\\nAGREEMENTS FOR THE LIQUEFACTION PROJECT. WHILE THE COUNTERPARTIES’ OBLIGATIONS ARE SUPPORTED BY PARENTAL GUARANTEES AND LETTERS OF CREDIT, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH CREDIT SUPPORT WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY THE OBLIGATIONS IN THE\\n\\nEVENT OF A COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. IN ADDITION, IF A CONTROVERSY ARISES UNDER EITHER AGREEMENT RESULTING IN A JUDGMENT IN DOMINION’S FAVOR, DOMINION MAY NEED TO SEEK TO ENFORCE A FINAL U.S. COURT JUDGMENT IN A FOREIGN TRIBUNAL, WHICH COULD\\n\\nINVOLVE A LENGTHY PROCESS.\\n\\nMARKET PERFORMANCE AND OTHER CHANGES MAY DECREASE THE VALUE OF DOMINION’S DECOMMISSIONING\\n\\nTRUST FUNDS AND DOMINION’S AND DOMINION GAS’ BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS OR INCREASE DOMINION’S AND DOMINION GAS’ LIABILITIES, WHICH COULD THEN REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL FUNDING.\\n\\nTHE PERFORMANCE OF THE CAPITAL MARKETS AFFECTS\\n\\nTHE VALUE OF THE ASSETS THAT ARE HELD IN TRUSTS TO SATISFY FUTURE OBLIGATIONS TO DECOMMISSION DOMINION’S NUCLEAR\\n\\nPLANTS AND UNDER DOMINION’S AND DOMINION GAS’ PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. DOMINION AND\\n\\nDOMINION GAS HAVE SIGNIFICANT OBLIGATIONS IN THESE AREAS AND HOLDS SIGNIFICANT ASSETS IN THESE TRUSTS. THESE ASSETS ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET FLUCTUATION AND WILL YIELD UNCERTAIN RETURNS, WHICH MAY FALL BELOW EXPECTED RETURN RATES.\\n\\nWITH RESPECT TO DECOMMISSIONING TRUST FUNDS, A DECLINE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF THESE ASSETS MAY INCREASE THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF THE\\n\\nOBLIGATIONS TO DECOMMISSION DOMINION’S NUCLEAR PLANTS OR REQUIRE ADDITIONAL NRC-APPROVED FUNDING ASSURANCE.\\n\\nA DECLINE IN\\n\\nTHE MARKET VALUE OF THE ASSETS HELD IN TRUSTS TO SATISFY FUTURE OBLIGATIONS UNDER DOMINION’S AND DOMINION GAS’ PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS MAY INCREASE THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS UNDER SUCH PLANS. ADDITIONALLY, CHANGES IN\\n\\nINTEREST RATES WILL AFFECT THE LIABILITIES UNDER DOMINION’S AND DOMINION GAS’ PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS; AS INTEREST RATES DECREASE, THE LIABILITIES INCREASE, POTENTIALLY REQUIRING ADDITIONAL FUNDING. FURTHER, CHANGES\\n\\nIN DEMOGRAPHICS, INCLUDING INCREASED NUMBERS OF RETIREMENTS OR CHANGES IN MORTALITY ASSUMPTIONS, MAY ALSO INCREASE THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF THE OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO THE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS.\\n\\nIF THE DECOMMISSIONING TRUST FUNDS AND BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS ARE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY MARKET FLUCTUATIONS OR OTHER FACTORS,\\n\\nDOMINION’S AND DOMINION GAS’ RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND/OR CASH FLOWS COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.\\n\\nTHE USE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS COULD RESULT IN FINANCIAL LOSSES AND LIQUIDITY CONSTRAINTS.\\n\\nTHE COMPANIES USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING FUTURES, SWAPS, FORWARDS, OPTIONS AND\\n\\nFTRS,\\n\\nTO MANAGE COMMODITY AND FINANCIAL MARKET RISKS. IN ADDITION, DOMINION AND DOMINION GAS PURCHASE AND SELL COMMODITY-BASED CONTRACTS FOR HEDGING PURPOSES.\\n\\nTHE DODD-FRANK ACT WAS ENACTED INTO LAW IN JULY 2010 IN AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE REGULATION OF FINANCIAL MARKETS. THE DODD-FRANK ACT INCLUDES PROVISIONS THAT WILL REQUIRE CERTAIN OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES,\\n\\nOR SWAPS, TO BE CENTRALLY CLEARED AND EXECUTED THROUGH AN EXCHANGE OR OTHER APPROVED TRADING PLATFORM. NON-FINANCIAL ENTITIES THAT USE SWAPS TO HEDGE OR MITIGATE COMMERCIAL RISK, OFTEN REFERRED TO AS END USERS, CAN CHOOSE TO EXEMPT THEIR HEDGING\\n\\nTRANSACTIONS FROM THESE CLEARING AND EXCHANGE TRADING REQUIREMENTS. FINAL RULES FOR THE OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVE-RELATED PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT WILL CONTINUE TO BE\\n\\n30\\n\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\n\\nESTABLISHED THROUGH THE ONGOING RULEMAKING PROCESS OF THE APPLICABLE REGULATORS, INCLUDING RULES REGARDING MARGIN REQUIREMENTS FOR NON-CLEARED SWAPS. IF, AS A RESULT OF THE RULEMAKING PROCESS,\\n\\nTHE COMPANIES’ DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES ARE NOT EXEMPTED FROM THE CLEARING, EXCHANGE TRADING OR MARGIN REQUIREMENTS, THE COMPANIES COULD BE SUBJECT TO HIGHER COSTS, INCLUDING FROM HIGHER MARGIN REQUIREMENTS, FOR THEIR DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES. IN\\n\\nADDITION, IMPLEMENTATION OF, AND COMPLIANCE WITH, THE SWAPS PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT BY THE COMPANIES’ COUNTERPARTIES COULD RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS RELATED TO THE COMPANIES’ DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES.\\n\\nCHANGING RATING AGENCY REQUIREMENTS COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMPANIES’ GROWTH AND BUSINESS STRATEGY.\\n\\nIN ORDER TO MAINTAIN\\n\\nAPPROPRIATE CREDIT RATINGS TO OBTAIN NEEDED CREDIT AT A REASONABLE COST IN LIGHT OF EXISTING OR FUTURE RATING AGENCY REQUIREMENTS, THE COMPANIES MAY FIND IT NECESSARY TO TAKE STEPS OR CHANGE THEIR BUSINESS PLANS IN WAYS THAT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT\\n\\nTHEIR GROWTH AND\\n\\nEARNINGS. A REDUCTION IN THE COMPANIES’ CREDIT RATINGS COULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN BORROWING COSTS, LOSS OF ACCESS TO CERTAIN MARKETS, OR BOTH, THUS ADVERSELY AFFECTING OPERATING RESULTS AND COULD REQUIRE THE\\n\\nCOMPANIES TO POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL IN CONNECTION WITH SOME OF ITS PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES.\\n\\nAN\\n\\nINABILITY TO ACCESS FINANCIAL MARKETS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE EXECUTION OF THE COMPANIES’ BUSINESS PLANS.\\n\\nTHE COMPANIES RELY ON ACCESS TO SHORT-TERM MONEY MARKETS AND LONGER-TERM CAPITAL MARKETS AS SIGNIFICANT SOURCES OF FUNDING AND\\n\\nLIQUIDITY FOR BUSINESS PLANS WITH INCREASING CAPITAL EXPENDITURE NEEDS, NORMAL WORKING CAPITAL AND COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO HEDGES OF FUTURE SALES AND PURCHASES OF ENERGY-RELATED COMMODITIES. DETERIORATION IN THE COMPANIES’\\n\\nCREDITWORTHINESS, AS EVALUATED BY CREDIT RATING AGENCIES OR OTHERWISE, OR DECLINES IN MARKET\\n\\nREPUTATION EITHER FOR THE COMPANIES OR THEIR INDUSTRY IN GENERAL, OR GENERAL FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTIONS OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANIES’ CONTROL\\n\\nCOULD INCREASE THEIR COST OF BORROWING OR RESTRICT THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS ONE OR MORE FINANCIAL MARKETS. FURTHER MARKET DISRUPTIONS COULD STEM FROM DELAYS IN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC\\n\\nRECOVERY, THE BANKRUPTCY OF AN UNRELATED COMPANY, GENERAL\\n\\nMARKET DISRUPTION DUE TO GENERAL CREDIT MARKET OR POLITICAL EVENTS, OR THE FAILURE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ON WHICH THE COMPANIES RELY. INCREASED COSTS AND RESTRICTIONS ON THE COMPANIES’ ABILITY TO ACCESS FINANCIAL MARKETS MAY BE SEVERE\\n\\nENOUGH TO AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO EXECUTE THEIR BUSINESS PLANS AS SCHEDULED.\\n\\nPOTENTIAL CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING\\n\\nPRACTICES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANIES’ FINANCIAL RESULTS.\\n\\nTHE COMPANIES CANNOT PREDICT THE IMPACT THAT FUTURE CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS OR PRACTICES MAY HAVE ON PUBLIC COMPANIES IN GENERAL, THE ENERGY INDUSTRY OR THEIR\\n\\nOPERATIONS SPECIFICALLY. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS COULD BE ISSUED THAT COULD CHANGE THE WAY THEY RECORD REVENUES, EXPENSES, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THESE CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT EARNINGS OR COULD INCREASE\\n\\nLIABILITIES.\\n\\nWAR, ACTS AND THREATS OF TERRORISM, INTENTIONAL ACTS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT EVENTS COULD ADVERSELY\\n\\nAFFECT THE COMPANIES’ OPERATIONS.\\n\\nTHE COMPANIES CANNOT PREDICT THE IMPACT THAT ANY FUTURE TERRORIST ATTACKS MAY HAVE ON THE ENERGY INDUSTRY IN GENERAL, OR ON THE COMPANIES’ BUSINESS IN PARTICULAR. ANY RETALIATORY MILITARY STRIKES OR\\n\\nSUSTAINED MILITARY CAMPAIGN MAY AFFECT THE COMPANIES’ OPERATIONS IN UNPREDICTABLE WAYS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN INSURANCE MARKETS AND DISRUPTIONS OF FUEL SUPPLIES AND MARKETS. IN ADDITION,\\n\\nTHE COMPANIES’ INFRASTRUCTURE FACILITIES COULD BE DIRECT TARGETS OF, OR INDIRECT CASUALTIES OF, AN ACT OF TERROR. FOR EXAMPLE, A PHYSICAL ATTACK ON A CRITICAL SUBSTATION IN CALIFORNIA\\n\\nRESULTED IN SERIOUS IMPACTS TO THE POWER GRID. FURTHERMORE, THE PHYSICAL COMPROMISE OF THE COMPANIES’ FACILITIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANIES’ ABILITY TO MANAGE THESE FACILITIES EFFECTIVELY. INSTABILITY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS AS A\\n\\nRESULT OF TERRORISM, WAR, INTENTIONAL ACTS, PANDEMIC, CREDIT CRISES, RECESSION OR OTHER FACTORS COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE U.S. ECONOMY AND INCREASE THE COST OF INSURANCE COVERAGE. THIS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANIES’\\n\\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.\\n\\nHOSTILE CYBER INTRUSIONS COULD SEVERELY IMPAIR THE COMPANIES’\\n\\nOPERATIONS, LEAD TO THE DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, DAMAGE THE REPUTATION OF THE COMPANIES AND OTHERWISE HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANIES’ BUSINESS.\\n\\nTHE COMPANIES OWN ASSETS DEEMED AS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE, THE\\n\\nOPERATION OF WHICH IS DEPENDENT ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS. FURTHER, THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS THAT RUN THE COMPANIES’ FACILITIES ARE NOT COMPLETELY ISOLATED FROM EXTERNAL NETWORKS. THERE APPEARS TO BE AN INCREASING LEVEL OF ACTIVITY,\\n\\nSOPHISTICATION AND MATURITY OF THREAT ACTORS, IN PARTICULAR NATION STATE ACTORS, THAT WISH TO DISRUPT THE U.S. BULK POWER SYSTEM AND THE U.S. GAS TRANSMISSION OR DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. SUCH PARTIES COULD VIEW THE COMPANIES’ COMPUTER SYSTEMS,\\n\\nSOFTWARE OR NETWORKS AS ATTRACTIVE TARGETS FOR CYBER ATTACK. FOR EXAMPLE, MALWARE HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO TARGET SOFTWARE THAT RUNS THE NATION’S CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SUCH AS POWER TRANSMISSION GRIDS AND GAS PIPELINES. IN ADDITION, THE\\n\\nCOMPANIES’ BUSINESSES REQUIRE THAT THEY AND THEIR VENDORS COLLECT AND MAINTAIN SENSITIVE CUSTOMER DATA, AS WELL AS CONFIDENTIAL EMPLOYEE AND SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO ELECTRONIC THEFT OR LOSS.\\n\\nA SUCCESSFUL CYBER ATTACK ON THE SYSTEMS THAT CONTROL THE COMPANIES’ ELECTRIC GENERATION, ELECTRIC OR GAS TRANSMISSION OR\\n\\nDISTRIBUTION ASSETS COULD SEVERELY DISRUPT BUSINESS OPERATIONS, PREVENTING THE COMPANIES FROM SERVING CUSTOMERS OR COLLECTING REVENUES. THE BREACH OF CERTAIN BUSINESS SYSTEMS COULD AFFECT THE COMPANIES’ ABILITY TO CORRECTLY RECORD, PROCESS AND\\n\\nREPORT FINANCIAL INFORMATION. A MAJOR CYBER INCIDENT COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES TO INVESTIGATE AND REPAIR SECURITY BREACHES OR SYSTEM DAMAGE AND COULD LEAD TO LITIGATION, FINES, OTHER REMEDIAL ACTION, HEIGHTENED REGULATORY SCRUTINY AND\\n\\nDAMAGE TO THE COMPANIES’ REPUTATION. IN ADDITION, THE MISAPPROPRIATION, CORRUPTION OR LOSS OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION AND OTHER CONFIDENTIAL DATA COULD LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT BREACH NOTIFICATION EXPENSES AND MITIGATION EXPENSES SUCH AS\\n\\nCREDIT MONITORING. THE COMPANIES MAINTAIN PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE THAT MAY COVER CERTAIN DAMAGE CAUSED BY POTENTIAL CYBER INCIDENTS; HOWEVER, OTHER DAMAGE AND CLAIMS ARISING FROM SUCH INCIDENTS MAY NOT BE COVERED OR MAY EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF\\n\\nANY INSURANCE AVAILABLE. FOR THESE REASONS, A SIGNIFICANT CYBER INCIDENT COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANIES’ BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\\n\\nFAILURE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER APPROPRIATELY QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE\\n\\nCOMPANIES’ OPERATIONS.\\n\\nTHE COMPANIES’ BUSINESS STRATEGY IS DEPENDENT ON THEIR ABILITY TO RECRUIT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE EMPLOYEES. THE COMPANIES’ KEY EXECUTIVE OFFICERS ARE THE CEO, CFO AND PRESIDENTS AND THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR\\n\\nFINANCIAL, OPERATIONAL, LEGAL, REGULATORY AND ACCOUNTING FUNCTIONS. COMPETITION\\n\\n31\\n\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\n\\nFOR SKILLED MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES IN THESE AREAS OF THE COMPANIES’ BUSINESS OPERATIONS IS HIGH. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE IS REQUIRED OF THE COMPANIES’ TECHNICAL\\n\\nEMPLOYEES FOR TRANSMISSION, GENERATION AND DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS. THE COMPANIES’ INABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN THESE EMPLOYEES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THEIR BUSINESS AND FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS. AN AGING WORKFORCE IN THE ENERGY INDUSTRY\\n\\nALSO NECESSITATES RECRUITING, RETAINING AND DEVELOPING THE NEXT GENERATION OF LEADERSHIP.\\n\\nDOMINION MAY BE UNABLE TO\\n\\nCOMPLETE THE QUESTAR COMBINATION OR, IN ORDER TO DO SO, THE COMBINED COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH MATERIAL RESTRICTIONS OR CONDITIONS.\\n\\nON FEBRUARY 1, 2016, DOMINION ANNOUNCED THE EXECUTION OF A MERGER AGREEMENT WITH QUESTAR. BEFORE THE\\n\\nQUESTAR COMBINATION MAY BE COMPLETED, APPROVAL BY THE SHAREHOLDERS OF QUESTAR WILL HAVE TO BE OBTAINED. IN ADDITION, VARIOUS FILINGS MUST BE MADE WITH VARIOUS STATE UTILITY, REGULATORY, ANTITRUST AND OTHER AUTHORITIES IN THE U.S. THESE GOVERNMENTAL\\n\\nAUTHORITIES MAY IMPOSE CONDITIONS ON THE COMPLETION, OR REQUIRE CHANGES TO THE TERMS, OF THE TRANSACTION, INCLUDING RESTRICTIONS OR CONDITIONS ON THE BUSINESS, OPERATIONS, OR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE COMBINED COMPANY FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF THE\\n\\nTRANSACTION. SEVERAL PARTIES HAVE FILED A COMPLAINT IN COURT SEEKING TO ENJOIN THE MERGER. ADDITIONAL PARTIES MAY ALSO SEEK TO ENJOIN THE MERGER IN COURT OR CHALLENGE REGULATORY FILINGS. THESE CONDITIONS, CHANGES OR CHALLENGES COULD HAVE THE EFFECT\\n\\nOF DELAYING COMPLETION OF THE ACQUISITION OR IMPOSING ADDITIONAL COSTS ON OR LIMITING THE REVENUES OF THE COMBINED COMPANY FOLLOWING THE TRANSACTION, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH\\n\\nFLOWS OF THE COMBINED COMPANY AND/OR CAUSE EITHER DOMINION OR QUESTAR TO ABANDON THE TRANSACTION.\\n\\nIF COMPLETED, THE QUESTAR\\n\\nCOMBINATION MAY NOT ACHIEVE ITS INTENDED RESULTS.\\n\\nDOMINION AND QUESTAR ENTERED INTO THE MERGER AGREEMENT WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT THE TRANSACTION WOULD RESULT IN VARIOUS BENEFITS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, BEING ACCRETIVE TO EARNINGS AND\\n\\nADDING TO DOMINION’S INVENTORY OF REGULATED ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE ASSETS. ACHIEVING THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE TRANSACTION IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING WHETHER THE BUSINESS OF QUESTAR IS INTEGRATED IN AN EFFICIENT AND\\n\\nEFFECTIVE MANNER. FAILURE TO ACHIEVE THESE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS COULD RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS, DECREASES IN THE AMOUNT OF EXPECTED REVENUES GENERATED BY THE COMBINED COMPANY AND DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT’S TIME AND ENERGY, ALL OF WHICH COULD\\n\\nHAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMBINED COMPANY’S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.\\n\\nFAILURE TO\\n\\nCOMPLETE THE TRANSACTION WITH QUESTAR COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT DOMINION’S STOCK PRICE AND DOMINION’S FUTURE BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.\\n\\nIF THE QUESTAR COMBINATION IS NOT COMPLETED, DOMINION’S ONGOING BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL\\n\\nRESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND DOMINION WILL BE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF RISKS, INCLUDING (I) DOMINION MAY BE REQUIRED, UNDER SPECIFIED CIRCUMSTANCES SET FORTH IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT, TO PAY QUESTAR A TERMINATION FEE OF $154 ; (II)\\n\\nDOMINION WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY COSTS RELATING TO THE TRANSACTION, INCLUDING LEGAL, ACCOUNTING, FINANCIAL ADVISORY, FILING AND PRINTING COSTS, WHETHER OR NOT THE TRANSACTION IS COMPLETED; AND (III) EXECUTION OF THE QUESTAR COMBINATION (INCLUDING\\n\\nINTEGRATION PLANNING) MAY REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL COMMITMENTS OF TIME AND RESOURCES BY OUR MANAGEMENT, WHICH COULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN DEVOTED TO OTHER OPPORTUNITIES THAT MAY HAVE BEEN BENEFICIAL TO DOMINION.\\n\\nDOMINION COULD ALSO BE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION RELATED TO ANY FAILURE TO COMPLETE THE\\n\\nTRANSACTION WITH QUESTAR. IF THE TRANSACTION IS NOT COMPLETED, THESE RISKS MAY MATERIALIZE AND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT DOMINION’S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.\\n\\nITEM 1B.

DOMINION HAS DISCUSSED THE DEVELOPMENT, SELECTION AND DISCLOSURE OF EACH OF THESE POLICIES WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS.\\n\\nA\\n\\nCCOUNTING\\n\\nFOR\\n\\nR\\n\\nEGULATED\\n\\nO\\n\\nPERATIONS\\n\\nTHE ACCOUNTING FOR DOMINION’S REGULATED ELECTRIC AND GAS OPERATIONS DIFFERS FROM THE ACCOUNTING FOR NONREGULATED OPERATIONS IN THAT\\n\\nDOMINION IS REQUIRED TO REFLECT THE EFFECT OF RATE REGULATION IN ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FOR REGULATED BUSINESSES SUBJECT TO FEDERAL OR STATE COST-OF-SERVICE RATE REGULATION, REGULATORY PRACTICES THAT ASSIGN COSTS TO ACCOUNTING\\n\\nPERIODS MAY DIFFER FROM ACCOUNTING METHODS GENERALLY APPLIED BY NONREGULATED COMPANIES. WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT REGULATORS WILL PERMIT THE RECOVERY OF CURRENT COSTS THROUGH FUTURE RATES CHARGED TO CUSTOMERS, THESE COSTS THAT OTHERWISE WOULD BE\\n\\nEXPENSED BY NONREGULATED COMPANIES ARE DEFERRED AS REGULATORY ASSETS. LIKEWISE, REGULATORY LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT REGULATORS WILL REQUIRE CUSTOMER REFUNDS THROUGH FUTURE RATES OR WHEN REVENUE IS COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS\\n\\nFOR EXPENDITURES THAT HAVE YET TO BE INCURRED. GENERALLY, REGULATORY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE AMORTIZED INTO INCOME OVER THE PERIOD AUTHORIZED BY THE REGULATOR.\\n\\nDOMINION EVALUATES WHETHER OR NOT RECOVERY OF ITS REGULATORY ASSETS THROUGH FUTURE RATES IS PROBABLE AND MAKES VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS IN ITS ANALYSIS. THE EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE RECOVERY ARE GENERALLY BASED\\n\\nON ORDERS ISSUED BY REGULATORY COMMISSIONS, LEGISLATION OR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, AS WELL AS DISCUSSIONS WITH APPLICABLE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES AND LEGAL COUNSEL. IF RECOVERY OF A REGULATORY ASSET IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN PROBABLE, IT WILL BE\\n\\nWRITTEN OFF IN THE PERIOD SUCH ASSESSMENT IS MADE. SEE NOTES 12 AND 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.\\n\\nA\\n\\nSSET\\n\\nR\\n\\nETIREMENT\\n\\nO\\n\\nBLIGATIONS\\n\\nDOMINION RECOGNIZES LIABILITIES FOR THE EXPECTED COST OF RETIRING TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR WHICH A LEGAL OBLIGATION EXISTS AND THE ARO CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THESE AROS ARE RECOGNIZED AT FAIR\\n\\nVALUE AS INCURRED AND ARE CAPITALIZED AS PART OF THE COST OF THE RELATED LONG-LIVED ASSETS. IN THE ABSENCE OF QUOTED MARKET PRICES, DOMINION ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS AROS USING PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUES, IN WHICH IT MAKES VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS\\n\\nINCLUDING ESTIMATES OF THE AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH RETIREMENT ACTIVITIES, CREDIT-ADJUSTED RISK FREE RATES AND COST ESCALATION RATES. THE IMPACT ON MEASUREMENTS OF NEW AROS OR REMEASUREMENTS OF EXISTING AROS, USING\\n\\nDIFFERENT COST ESCALATION RATES IN THE FUTURE, MAY BE SIGNIFICANT. WHEN DOMINION REVISES ANY ASSUMPTIONS USED TO CALCULATE THE FAIR VALUE OF EXISTING AROS, IT ADJUSTS THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF BOTH THE ARO LIABILITY AND THE RELATED LONG-LIVED ASSET FOR\\n\\nASSETS THAT ARE IN SERVICE; FOR ASSETS THAT HAVE CEASED OPERATIONS, DOMINION ADJUSTS THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ARO LIABILITY WITH SUCH CHANGES RECOGNIZED IN INCOME. DOMINION ACCRETES THE ARO LIABILITY TO REFLECT THE PASSAGE OF TIME. IN 2015,\\n\\nDOMINION RECORDED AN INCREASE IN AROS OF $403  PRIMARILY RELATED TO FUTURE ASH POND AND LANDFILL CLOSURE COSTS AT CERTAIN UTILITY GENERATION FACILITIES. SEE NOTE 22 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.\\n\\nIN 2015, 2014 AND 2013, DOMINION RECOGNIZED $93 , $81  AND $86 , RESPECTIVELY, OF ACCRETION, AND EXPECTS\\n\\nTO RECOGNIZE $99  IN 2016. DOMINION RECORDS ACCRETION AND DEPRECIATION ASSOCIATED WITH UTILITY NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING AROS AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE REGULATORY LIABILITY RELATED TO ITS NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING TRUST.\\n\\n41\\n\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\n\\n, CONTINUED\\n\\nA SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF DOMINION’S AROS RELATES TO THE FUTURE DECOMMISSIONING OF ITS\\n\\nMERCHANT AND UTILITY NUCLEAR FACILITIES. THESE NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING AROS ARE REPORTED IN THE DOMINION GENERATION SEGMENT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, DOMINION’S NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING AROS TOTALED $1.5 , REPRESENTING\\n\\nAPPROXIMATELY 70% OF ITS TOTAL AROS. BASED ON THEIR SIGNIFICANCE, THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS INHERENT IN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF AROS RELATES TO THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH DOMINION’S NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING OBLIGATIONS.\\n\\nDOMINION OBTAINS FROM THIRD-PARTY SPECIALISTS PERIODIC SITE-SPECIFIC BASE YEAR COST STUDIES IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE NATURE,\\n\\nCOST AND TIMING OF PLANNED DECOMMISSIONING ACTIVITIES FOR ITS NUCLEAR PLANTS. THESE COST STUDIES ARE BASED ON RELEVANT INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE TIME THEY ARE PERFORMED; HOWEVER, ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME ARE BY\\n\\nNATURE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AND MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ACTUAL RESULTS. IN ADDITION, DOMINION’S COST ESTIMATES INCLUDE COST ESCALATION RATES THAT ARE APPLIED TO THE BASE YEAR COSTS. DOMINION DETERMINES COST ESCALATION RATES, WHICH REPRESENT\\n\\nPROJECTED COST INCREASES OVER TIME DUE TO BOTH GENERAL INFLATION AND INCREASES IN THE COST OF SPECIFIC DECOMMISSIONING ACTIVITIES, FOR EACH NUCLEAR FACILITY. THE SELECTION OF THESE COST ESCALATION RATES IS DEPENDENT ON SUBJECTIVE FACTORS WHICH ARE\\n\\nCONSIDERED TO BE CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS.\\n\\nPRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF A SHIFT OF THE DELAYED PLANNED DATE ON WHICH THE DOE WAS\\n\\nEXPECTED TO BEGIN ACCEPTING SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL, IN 2014, DOMINION RECORDED AN INCREASE OF $95  TO THE NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING AROS.\\n\\nI\\n\\nNCOME\\n\\nT\\n\\nAXES\\n\\nJUDGMENT AND THE USE OF ESTIMATES ARE REQUIRED IN DEVELOPING THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES AND REPORTING OF TAX-RELATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE\\n\\nINTERPRETATION OF TAX LAWS INVOLVES UNCERTAINTY, SINCE TAX AUTHORITIES MAY INTERPRET THE LAWS DIFFERENTLY. ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF INCOME TAX MATTERS MAY RESULT IN FAVORABLE OR UNFAVORABLE IMPACTS TO NET INCOME AND CASH FLOWS, AND ADJUSTMENTS TO\\n\\nTAX-RELATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES COULD BE MATERIAL.\\n\\nGIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY AND JUDGMENT INVOLVED IN THE DETERMINATION AND\\n\\nFILING OF INCOME TAXES, THERE ARE STANDARDS FOR RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF POSITIONS TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN BY AN ENTITY IN ITS INCOME TAX RETURNS. POSITIONS TAKEN BY AN ENTITY IN ITS INCOME TAX RETURNS THAT ARE\\n\\nRECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MUST SATISFY A MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT RECOGNITION THRESHOLD, ASSUMING THAT THE POSITION WILL BE EXAMINED BY TAX AUTHORITIES WITH FULL KNOWLEDGE OF ALL RELEVANT INFORMATION. AT DECEMBER 31, 2015,\\n\\nDOMINION HAD $103  OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. CHANGES IN THESE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS MAY RESULT FROM REMEASUREMENT OF AMOUNTS EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED, SETTLEMENTS WITH TAX AUTHORITIES AND EXPIRATION OF STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS.\\n\\nDEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECORDED REPRESENTING FUTURE EFFECTS ON INCOME TAXES FOR TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES\\n\\nBETWEEN THE BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING AND TAX PURPOSES. DOMINION EVALUATES QUARTERLY THE PROBABILITY OF REALIZING DEFERRED TAX ASSETS BY CONSIDERING CURRENT AND HISTORICAL FINANCIAL RESULTS, EXPECTATIONS FOR FUTURE\\n\\nTAXABLE INCOME AND THE AVAILABILITY OF TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED, IF NECESSARY, TO REALIZE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. FAILURE TO ACHIEVE FORECASTED TAXABLE INCOME OR SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES MAY AFFECT THE\\n\\nREALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. DOMINION ESTABLISHES A VALUATION ALLOWANCE WHEN IT IS MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT THAT ALL OR A PORTION OF A\\n\\nDEFERRED TAX ASSET WILL NOT BE REALIZED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, DOMINION HAD ESTABLISHED $73  OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES.\\n\\nA\\n\\nCCOUNTING\\n\\nFOR\\n\\nD\\n\\nERIVATIVE\\n\\nC\\n\\nONTRACTS\\n\\nAND\\n\\nO\\n\\nTHER\\n\\nI\\n\\nNSTRUMENTS\\n\\nAT\\n\\nF\\n\\nAIR\\n\\nV\\n\\nALUE\\n\\nDOMINION USES DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS SUCH AS FUTURES, SWAPS, FORWARDS, OPTIONS AND FTRS TO MANAGE COMMODITY AND\\n\\nFINANCIAL MARKET RISKS OF ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS. DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, ARE REPORTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE. ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS FOR DERIVATIVES AND RELATED HEDGING ACTIVITIES ARE COMPLEX AND\\n\\nMAY BE SUBJECT TO FURTHER CLARIFICATION BY STANDARD-SETTING BODIES. THE MAJORITY OF INVESTMENTS HELD IN DOMINION’S NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING AND RABBI AND BENEFIT PLAN TRUST FUNDS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING. SEE NOTES 6 AND 21 TO\\n\\nTHE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THESE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.\\n\\nFAIR VALUE IS BASED ON\\n\\nACTIVELY-QUOTED MARKET PRICES, IF AVAILABLE. IN THE ABSENCE OF ACTIVELY-QUOTED MARKET PRICES, MANAGEMENT SEEKS INDICATIVE PRICE INFORMATION FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES, INCLUDING BROKER QUOTES AND INDUSTRY PUBLICATIONS. WHEN EVALUATING PRICING INFORMATION\\n\\nPROVIDED BY BROKERS AND OTHER PRICING SERVICES, DOMINION CONSIDERS WHETHER THE BROKER IS WILLING AND ABLE TO TRADE AT THE QUOTED PRICE, IF THE BROKER QUOTES ARE BASED ON AN ACTIVE MARKET OR AN INACTIVE MARKET AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH BROKERS ARE\\n\\nUTILIZING A PARTICULAR MODEL IF PRICING IS NOT READILY AVAILABLE. IF PRICING INFORMATION FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES IS NOT AVAILABLE, OR IF DOMINION BELIEVES THAT OBSERVABLE PRICING INFORMATION IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FAIR VALUE, JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO\\n\\nDEVELOP THE ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE. IN THOSE CASES, DOMINION MUST ESTIMATE PRICES BASED ON AVAILABLE HISTORICAL AND NEAR-TERM FUTURE PRICE INFORMATION AND USE OF STATISTICAL METHODS, INCLUDING REGRESSION ANALYSIS, THAT REFLECT ITS MARKET\\n\\nASSUMPTIONS.\\n\\nDOMINION MAXIMIZES THE USE OF OBSERVABLE INPUTS AND MINIMIZES THE USE OF UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS WHEN MEASURING FAIR\\n\\nVALUE.\\n\\nU\\n\\nSE\\n\\nOF\\n\\nE\\n\\nSTIMATES\\n\\nIN\\n\\nG\\n\\nOODWILL\\n\\nI\\n\\nMPAIRMENT\\n\\nT\\n\\nESTING\\n\\nAS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, DOMINION REPORTED $3.3  OF GOODWILL IN ITS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. A\\n\\nSIGNIFICANT PORTION RESULTED FROM THE ACQUISITION OF THE FORMER CNG IN 2000.\\n\\nIN APRIL OF EACH YEAR, DOMINION TESTS ITS\\n\\nGOODWILL FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT, AND PERFORMS ADDITIONAL TESTS MORE FREQUENTLY IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE IN THE INTERIM THAT WOULD MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. THE 2015,\\n\\n2014 AND 2013 ANNUAL TESTS AND ANY INTERIM TESTS DID NOT RESULT IN THE RECOGNITION OF ANY GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT.\\n\\nIN GENERAL,\\n\\nDOMINION ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS BY USING A COMBINATION OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AND OTHER VALUATION TECHNIQUES THAT USE MULTIPLES OF EARNINGS FOR PEER GROUP COMPANIES AND ANALYSES OF RECENT BUSINESS COMBINATIONS INVOLVING\\n\\nPEER GROUP COMPANIES. FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES ARE DEPENDENT ON SUBJECTIVE FACTORS SUCH AS DOMINION’S ESTIMATE OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, THE SELECTION OF APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT AND GROWTH RATES, AND THE SELECTION OF PEER GROUP COMPANIES AND RECENT\\n\\nTRANSACTIONS. THESE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES ARE MADE AS OF A POINT IN TIME; SUBSEQUENT MODIFICATIONS, PARTICULARLY CHANGES IN DISCOUNT RATES OR GROWTH RATES INHERENT IN DOMINION’S ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, COULD RESULT IN A\\n\\nFUTURE IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL. ALTHOUGH DOMINION HAS CONSISTENTLY APPLIED THE SAME\\n\\n42\\n\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\n\\nMETHODS IN DEVELOPING THE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES THAT UNDERLIE THE FAIR VALUE CALCULATIONS, SUCH AS ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AND BASED THOSE ESTIMATES ON RELEVANT INFORMATION AVAILABLE\\n\\nAT THE TIME, SUCH CASH FLOW ESTIMATES ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN BY NATURE AND MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ACTUAL RESULTS. IF THE ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS USED IN THE MOST RECENT TESTS HAD BEEN 10% LOWER, THE RESULTING FAIR VALUES WOULD HAVE STILL\\n\\nBEEN GREATER THAN THE CARRYING VALUES OF EACH OF THOSE REPORTING UNITS TESTED, INDICATING THAT NO IMPAIRMENT WAS PRESENT. SEE NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.\\n\\nU\\n\\nSE\\n\\nOF\\n\\nE\\n\\nSTIMATES\\n\\nIN\\n\\nL\\n\\nONG\\n\\n-L\\n\\nIVED\\n\\nA\\n\\nSSET\\n\\nI\\n\\nMPAIRMENT\\n\\nT\\n\\nESTING\\n\\nIMPAIRMENT TESTING FOR AN INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS OR FOR INTANGIBLE\\n\\nASSETS WITH DEFINITE LIVES IS REQUIRED WHEN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THOSE ASSETS MAY BE IMPAIRED. WHEN AN ASSET’S CARRYING AMOUNT EXCEEDS THE UNDISCOUNTED ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ASSET, THE ASSET IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED TO\\n\\nTHE EXTENT THAT THE ASSET’S FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. PERFORMING AN IMPAIRMENT TEST ON LONG-LIVED ASSETS INVOLVES JUDGMENT IN AREAS SUCH AS IDENTIFYING IF CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE AN IMPAIRMENT MAY EXIST, IDENTIFYING AND\\n\\nGROUPING AFFECTED ASSETS, AND DEVELOPING THE UNDISCOUNTED AND DISCOUNTED ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS (USED TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE IN THE ABSENCE OF MARKET-BASED VALUE) ASSOCIATED WITH THE ASSET, INCLUDING PROBABILITY WEIGHTING SUCH CASH FLOWS TO\\n\\nREFLECT EXPECTATIONS ABOUT POSSIBLE VARIATIONS IN THEIR AMOUNTS OR TIMING, EXPECTATIONS ABOUT OPERATING THE LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND THE SELECTION OF AN APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATE. WHEN DETERMINING WHETHER AN ASSET OR ASSET GROUP HAS BEEN IMPAIRED,\\n\\nMANAGEMENT GROUPS ASSETS AT THE LOWEST LEVEL THAT HAS IDENTIFIABLE CASH FLOWS. ALTHOUGH CASH FLOW ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON RELEVANT INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE TIME THE ESTIMATES ARE MADE, ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE, BY NATURE, HIGHLY\\n\\nUNCERTAIN AND MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ACTUAL RESULTS. FOR EXAMPLE, ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS WOULD CONTEMPLATE FACTORS WHICH MAY CHANGE OVER TIME, SUCH AS THE EXPECTED USE OF THE ASSET, INCLUDING FUTURE PRODUCTION AND SALES LEVELS, EXPECTED\\n\\nFLUCTUATIONS OF PRICES OF COMMODITIES SOLD AND CONSUMED AND EXPECTED PROCEEDS FROM DISPOSITIONS. SEE NOTE 6 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF IMPAIRMENTS RELATED TO CERTAIN LONG-LIVED ASSETS.\\n\\nE\\n\\nMPLOYEE\\n\\nB\\n\\nENEFIT\\n\\nP\\n\\nLANS\\n\\nDOMINION SPONSORS NONCONTRIBUTORY DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS FOR ELIGIBLE ACTIVE EMPLOYEES, RETIREES AND QUALIFYING DEPENDENTS. THE PROJECTED COSTS OF PROVIDING\\n\\nBENEFITS UNDER THESE PLANS ARE DEPENDENT, IN PART, ON HISTORICAL INFORMATION SUCH AS EMPLOYEE DEMOGRAPHICS, THE LEVEL OF CONTRIBUTIONS MADE TO THE PLANS AND EARNINGS ON PLAN ASSETS. ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE, INCLUDING THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE\\n\\nOF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, DISCOUNT RATES APPLIED TO BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, MORTALITY RATES AND THE ANTICIPATED RATE OF INCREASE IN HEALTHCARE COSTS AND PARTICIPANT COMPENSATION, ALSO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON EMPLOYEE BENEFIT COSTS. THE IMPACT OF\\n\\nCHANGES IN THESE FACTORS, AS WELL AS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DOMINION’S ASSUMPTIONS AND ACTUAL EXPERIENCE, IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME OVER THE REMAINING AVERAGE SERVICE PERIOD OF PLAN PARTICIPANTS, RATHER THAN\\n\\nIMMEDIATELY.\\n\\nTHE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, DISCOUNT RATES, HEALTHCARE COST\\n\\nTREND RATES AND MORTALITY RATES ARE CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS. DOMINION DETERMINES THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS FOR PENSION PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS BY USING A COMBINATION OF.\\n\\n•\\n\\nEXPECTED INFLATION AND RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE ASSUMPTIONS;\\n\\n•\\n\\nHISTORICAL RETURN ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE LONG-TERM HISTORIC RETURNS AS WELL AS HISTORIC RISK PREMIUMS FOR VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES;\\n\\n•\\n\\nEXPECTED FUTURE RISK PREMIUMS, ASSET VOLATILITIES AND CORRELATIONS;\\n\\n•\\n\\nFORECASTS OF AN INDEPENDENT INVESTMENT ADVISOR;\\n\\n•\\n\\nFORWARD-LOOKING RETURN EXPECTATIONS DERIVED FROM THE YIELD ON LONG-TERM BONDS AND THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURNS OF MAJOR STOCK MARKET INDICES; AND\\n\\n•\\n\\nINVESTMENT ALLOCATION OF PLAN ASSETS. THE STRATEGIC TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION FOR DOMINION’S PENSION FUNDS IS 28% U.S. EQUITY, 18% NON-U.S. EQUITY,\\n\\n35% FIXED INCOME, 3% REAL ESTATE AND 16% OTHER ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS, SUCH AS PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS.\\n\\nSTRATEGIC INVESTMENT POLICIES ARE ESTABLISHED FOR DOMINION’S PREFUNDED BENEFIT PLANS BASED UPON PERIODIC ASSET/LIABILITY STUDIES.\\n\\nFACTORS CONSIDERED IN SETTING THE INVESTMENT POLICY INCLUDE THOSE MENTIONED ABOVE SUCH AS EMPLOYEE DEMOGRAPHICS, LIABILITY GROWTH RATES, FUTURE DISCOUNT RATES, THE FUNDED STATUS OF THE PLANS AND THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS.\\n\\nDEVIATIONS FROM THE PLANS’ STRATEGIC ALLOCATION ARE A FUNCTION OF DOMINION’S ASSESSMENTS REGARDING SHORT-TERM RISK AND REWARD OPPORTUNITIES IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND/OR SHORT-TERM MARKET MOVEMENTS WHICH RESULT IN THE PLANS’ ACTUAL\\n\\nASSET ALLOCATIONS VARYING FROM THE STRATEGIC TARGET ASSET ALLOCATIONS. THROUGH PERIODIC REBALANCING, ACTUAL ALLOCATIONS ARE BROUGHT BACK IN LINE WITH THE TARGET. FUTURE ASSET/LIABILITY STUDIES WILL FOCUS ON STRATEGIES TO FURTHER REDUCE PENSION AND\\n\\nOTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLAN RISK, WHILE STILL ACHIEVING ATTRACTIVE LEVELS OF RETURNS.\\n\\nDOMINION DEVELOPS ASSUMPTIONS, WHICH ARE\\n\\nTHEN COMPARED TO THE FORECASTS OF AN INDEPENDENT INVESTMENT ADVISOR TO ENSURE REASONABLENESS. AN INTERNAL COMMITTEE SELECTS THE FINAL ASSUMPTIONS. DOMINION CALCULATED ITS PENSION COST USING AN EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS\\n\\nASSUMPTION OF 8.75% FOR 2015 AND 2014 AND 8.50% FOR 2013. FOR 2016, THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN FOR PENSION COST ASSUMPTION IS 8.75%. DOMINION CALCULATED ITS OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST USING AN EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON\\n\\nPLAN ASSETS ASSUMPTION OF 8.50% FOR 2015 AND 2014 AND 7.75% FOR 2013. FOR 2016, THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN FOR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST ASSUMPTION IS 8.50%. THE RATE USED IN CALCULATING OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST IS LOWER\\n\\nTHAN THE RATE USED IN CALCULATING PENSION COST BECAUSE OF DIFFERENCES IN THE RELATIVE AMOUNTS OF VARIOUS TYPES OF INVESTMENTS HELD AS PLAN ASSETS.\\n\\nDOMINION DETERMINES DISCOUNT RATES FROM ANALYSES OF AA/AA RATED BONDS WITH CASH FLOWS MATCHING THE EXPECTED PAYMENTS TO BE MADE UNDER ITS PLANS. THE DISCOUNT RATES USED TO CALCULATE PENSION COST AND OTHER\\n\\nPOSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST WERE 4.40% IN 2015, RANGED FROM 5.20% TO 5.30% FOR PENSION PLANS AND 5.00% TO 5.10% FOR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS IN 2014, AND RANGED FROM 4.40% TO 4.80% IN 2013. DOMINION SELECTED A DISCOUNT RATE RANGING FROM\\n\\n4.96% TO 4.99% FOR PENSION PLANS AND RANGING FROM 4.93% TO 4.94% FOR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS FOR DETERMINING ITS DECEMBER 31, 2015 PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS.\\n\\n43\\n\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\n\\n, CONTINUED\\n\\nDOMINION ESTABLISHES THE HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE ASSUMPTION BASED ON ANALYSES OF VARIOUS\\n\\nFACTORS INCLUDING THE SPECIFIC PROVISIONS OF ITS MEDICAL PLANS, ACTUAL COST TRENDS EXPERIENCED AND PROJECTED, AND DEMOGRAPHICS OF PLAN PARTICIPANTS. DOMINION’S HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE ASSUMPTION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015 WAS 7.00% AND IS\\n\\nEXPECTED TO GRADUALLY DECREASE TO 5.00% BY 2019 AND CONTINUE AT THAT RATE FOR YEARS THEREAFTER.\\n\\nDOMINION DEVELOPS ITS\\n\\nMORTALITY ASSUMPTION USING PLAN-SPECIFIC STUDIES AND PROJECTS MORTALITY IMPROVEMENT USING SCALES DEVELOPED BY THE SOCIETY OF ACTUARIES.\\n\\nTHE FOLLOWING TABLE ILLUSTRATES THE EFFECT ON COST OF CHANGING THE CRITICAL ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED, WHILE HOLDING ALL OTHER ASSUMPTIONS CONSTANT.\\n\\nINCREASE IN NET PERIODIC COST\\n\\nCHANGE IN\\n\\nACTUARIAL\\n\\nASSUMPTION\\n\\nPENSION\\n\\nBENEFITS\\n\\nOTHER\\n\\nPOSTRETIREMENT\\n\\nBENEFITS\\n\\n(, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES)\\n\\nDISCOUNT RATE\\n\\n(0.25\\n\\n)%\\n\\n$15\\n\\n$1\\n\\nLONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS\\n\\n(0.25\\n\\n)%\\n\\n16\\n\\n3\\n\\nHEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE\\n\\n1%\\n\\nN/A\\n\\n21\\n\\nIN ADDITION TO THE EFFECTS ON COST, AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, A 0.25% DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD\\n\\nINCREASE DOMINION’S PROJECTED PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY $212 \\n\\nAND ITS ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY $40 \\n\\n, WHILE A 1.00% INCREASE IN THE HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE WOULD INCREASE ITS ACCUMULATED\\n\\nPOSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY $157 .\\n\\nSEE NOTE 21 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL\\n\\nINFORMATION ON DOMINION’S EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.\\n\\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\\n\\nSEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.\\n\\nD\\n\\nOMINION\\n\\nR\\n\\nESULTS\\n\\nOF\\n\\nO\\n\\nPERATIONS\\n\\nPRESENTED BELOW IS A SUMMARY OF DOMINION’S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS.\\n\\nYEAR ENDED\\n\\nDECEMBER 31,\\n\\n2015\\n\\n$ CHANGE\\n\\n2014\\n\\n$ CHANGE\\n\\n2013\\n\\n(, EXCEPT EPS)\\n\\nNET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO DOMINION\\n\\n$1,899\\n\\n$589\\n\\n$1,310\\n\\n$(387\\n\\n)\\n\\n$1,697\\n\\nDILUTED EPS\\n\\n3.20\\n\\n0.96\\n\\n2.24\\n\\n(0.69\\n\\n)\\n\\n2.93\\n\\nOVERVIEW\\n\\n2015\\n\\nVS\\n\\n. 2014\\n\\nNET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO DOMINION INCREASED BY 45% PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH\\n\\nVIRGINIA LEGISLATION ENACTED IN APRIL 2014 RELATING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A THIRD NUCLEAR UNIT LOCATED AT NORTH ANNA AND OFFSHORE WIND FACILITIES, THE ABSENCE OF LOSSES RELATED TO THE REPOSITIONING OF DOMINION’S PRODUCER SERVICES BUSINESS IN\\n\\nTHE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014, AND THE ABSENCE OF CHARGES RELATED TO DOMINION’S LIABILITY\\n\\nMANAGE-\\n\\nMENT EXERCISE.

AS DISCUSSED IN\\n\\nCREDIT RATINGS\\n\\n, DOMINION’S\\n\\nABILITY TO BORROW FUNDS OR ISSUE SECURITIES AND THE RETURN DEMANDED BY INVESTORS ARE AFFECTED BY CREDIT RATINGS. IN ADDITION, THE RAISING OF EXTERNAL CAPITAL IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING REGISTRATION WITH THE SEC FOR\\n\\nCERTAIN ISSUANCES.\\n\\nDOMINION CURRENTLY MEETS THE DEFINITION OF A WELL-KNOWN SEASONED ISSUER UNDER SEC RULES GOVERNING THE\\n\\nREGISTRATION, COMMUNICATIONS AND OFFERING PROCESSES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933.

THE LEVELS OF BORROWING MAY VARY\\n\\nSIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE COURSE OF THE YEAR, DEPENDING UPON THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF CASH REQUIREMENTS NOT SATISFIED BY CASH FROM OPERATIONS. IN JANUARY 2016, DOMINION EXPANDED ITS SHORT-TERM FUNDING RESOURCES THROUGH A $1.0  INCREASE TO ONE\\n\\nOF ITS JOINT REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY LIMITS. IN ADDITION, DOMINION UTILIZES CASH AND LETTERS OF CREDIT TO FUND COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS. COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS ARE IMPACTED BY COMMODITY PRICES, HEDGING LEVELS, DOMINION’S CREDIT RATINGS AND\\n\\nTHE CREDIT QUALITY OF ITS COUNTERPARTIES.\\n\\nIN CONNECTION WITH COMMODITY HEDGING ACTIVITIES, DOMINION IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE\\n\\nCOLLATERAL TO COUNTERPARTIES UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES. UNDER CERTAIN COLLATERAL ARRANGEMENTS, DOMINION MAY SATISFY THESE REQUIREMENTS BY ELECTING TO EITHER DEPOSIT CASH, POST LETTERS OF CREDIT OR, IN SOME CASES, UTILIZE OTHER FORMS OF SECURITY. FROM\\n\\nTIME TO TIME, DOMINION MAY VARY THE FORM OF COLLATERAL PROVIDED TO COUNTERPARTIES AFTER WEIGHING THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF VARIOUS FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF COLLATERAL. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE SHORT-TERM BORROWING AND SHORT-TERM\\n\\nINVESTMENT RATES, THE SPREAD OVER THESE SHORT-TERM RATES AT WHICH DOMINION CAN ISSUE COMMERCIAL PAPER, BALANCE SHEET IMPACTS, THE COSTS AND FEES OF ALTERNATIVE COLLATERAL POSTINGS WITH THESE AND OTHER COUNTERPARTIES AND OVERALL LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT\\n\\nOBJECTIVES.\\n\\nDOMINION’S COMMERCIAL PAPER AND LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING, AS WELL AS CAPACITY\\n\\nAVAILABLE UNDER CREDIT FACILITIES, WERE AS FOLLOWS.\\n\\nDECEMBER 31, 2015\\n\\nFACILITY\\n\\nLIMIT\\n\\nOUTSTANDING\\n\\nCOMMERCIAL\\n\\nPAPER\\n\\nOUTSTANDING\\n\\nLETTERS OF\\n\\nCREDIT\\n\\nFACILITY\\n\\nCAPACITY\\n\\nAVAILABLE\\n\\n()\\n\\nJOINT REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n(2)\\n\\n$4,000\\n\\n$3,353\\n\\n$—\\n\\n$647\\n\\nJOINT REVOLVING CREDIT\\n\\nFACILITY\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n500\\n\\n156\\n\\n59\\n\\n285\\n\\nTOTAL\\n\\n$4,500\\n\\n$3,509\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n$59\\n\\n$932\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nTHESE CREDIT FACILITIES MATURE IN APRIL 2019, AND CAN BE USED TO SUPPORT BANK BORROWINGS AND THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, AS WELL AS TO SUPPORT UP TO A COMBINED\\n\\n$2.0  OF LETTERS OF CREDIT.\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nIN JANUARY 2016, THIS FACILITY LIMIT WAS INCREASED FROM $4.0  TO $5.0 .\\n\\n(3)\\n\\nTHE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF THE OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER SUPPORTED BY DOMINION’S CREDIT FACILITIES WAS 0.62% AT DECEMBER 31, 2015.\\n\\nS\\n\\nHORT\\n\\n-\\n\\nTERM\\n\\nN\\n\\nOTES\\n\\nIN NOVEMBER 2014, DOMINION ISSUED $400  OF PRIVATE PLACEMENT SHORT-TERM NOTES THAT MATURED AND WERE REPAID IN NOVEMBER 2015 AND BORE INTEREST AT A\\n\\nVARIABLE RATE.

THE COMMON UNITS MAY BE ACQUIRED BY DOMINION OVER THE 12 MONTH PERIOD FOLLOWING COMMENCEMENT OF THE PROGRAM AT THE DISCRETION OF MANAGEMENT. THROUGH DECEMBER 31,\\n\\n2015, DOMINION PURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 887,000 COMMON UNITS FOR $25 . IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2016, DOMINION PURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 377,000 ADDITIONAL COMMON UNITS FOR APPROXIMATELY $10 . AT FEBRUARY 23, 2016, DOMINION STILL HAS THE\\n\\nABILITY TO PURCHASE UP TO $15  OF COMMON UNITS UNDER THE PROGRAM.\\n\\nP\\n\\nROPOSED\\n\\nA\\n\\nCQUISITION\\n\\nOF\\n\\nQ\\n\\nUESTAR\\n\\nUNDER THE TERMS OF THE QUESTAR COMBINATION ANNOUNCED IN FEBRUARY 2016, DOMINION HAS AGREED TO PAY\\n\\nQUESTAR SHAREHOLDERS $25 PER SHARE, TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $4.4  AS WELL AS ASSUME QUESTAR’S OUTSTANDING DEBT, CURRENTLY APPROXIMATELY $1.6 , WHICH IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN OUTSTANDING FOLLOWING THE MERGER.

AT A MINIMUM, DELEGATED STATES ARE REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH REGULATORY\\n\\nPROGRAMS TO ADDRESS ALL REQUIREMENTS OF THE CAA. HOWEVER, STATES MAY CHOOSE TO DEVELOP REGULATORY PROGRAMS THAT ARE MORE RESTRICTIVE. MANY OF THE COMPANIES’ FACILITIES ARE SUBJECT TO THE CAA’S PERMITTING AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS.\\n\\nIN AUGUST 2015, THE EPA ISSUED FINAL CARBON STANDARDS FOR EXISTING FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS. KNOWN AS THE CLEAN POWER\\n\\nPLAN, THE RULE USES A SET OF MEASURES FOR REDUCING EMISSIONS FROM EXISTING SOURCES THAT INCLUDES EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS AT COAL PLANTS, DISPLACING COAL-FIRED GENERATION WITH INCREASED UTILIZATION OF NATURAL GAS COMBINED CYCLE UNITS AND EXPANDING\\n\\nRENEWABLE RESOURCES. THE NEW RULE REQUIRES STATES TO IMPOSE STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE LIMITS FOR EXISTING FOSSIL FUEL-FIRED ELECTRIC GENERATING UNITS OR EQUIVALENT STATEWIDE INTENSITY-BASED OR MASS-BASED CO\\n\\n2\\n\\nBINDING GOALS OR LIMITS. STATES ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT INTERIM PLANS TO\\n\\nTHE EPA BY SEPTEMBER 2016 IDENTIFYING HOW THEY WILL COMPLY WITH THE RULE, WITH FINAL PLANS DUE BY SEPTEMBER 2018. THE EPA ALSO PROPOSED A FEDERAL PLAN AND MODEL TRADING RULES THAT, WHEN FINALIZED, STATES CAN ADOPT OR THAT WOULD BE PUT IN PLACE IF,\\n\\nIN RESPONSE TO THE FINAL GUIDELINES, A STATE EITHER DOES NOT SUBMIT A STATE PLAN OR ITS PLAN IS NOT APPROVED BY THE EPA. VIRGINIA POWER’S MOST RECENT INTEGRATED RESOURCES PLAN FILED IN JULY 2015 INCLUDES FOUR ALTERNATIVE PLANS THAT REPRESENT\\n\\nPLAUSIBLE COMPLIANCE STRATEGIES WITH THE RULE AS PROPOSED, AND WHICH INCLUDE ADDITIONAL COAL UNIT RETIREMENTS AND ADDITIONAL LOW OR ZERO-CARBON RESOURCES. THE FINAL RULE HAS BEEN CHALLENGED IN THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE D.C. CIRCUIT. IN\\n\\nFEBRUARY 2016, THE U.S. SUPREME COURT ISSUED A STAY OF THE CLEAN POWER PLAN UNTIL THE DISPOSITION OF THE PETITIONS CHALLENGING THE RULE NOW BEFORE THE COURT OF APPEALS, AND, IF SUCH PETITIONS ARE FILED IN THE FUTURE, BEFORE THE U.S. SUPREME COURT.\\n\\nDOMINION DOES NOT KNOW WHETHER THESE LEGAL CHALLENGES WILL IMPACT THE SUBMITTAL DEADLINES FOR THE STATE IMPLEMENTATION PLANS. SUBSEQUENT TO THE STAY, VIRGINIA HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL CONTINUE DEVELOPMENT OF A STATE PLAN. UNLESS THE RULE SURVIVES\\n\\nTHE COURT CHALLENGES AND UNTIL THE STATE PLANS ARE DEVELOPED AND THE EPA APPROVES THE PLANS, DOMINION CANNOT PREDICT THE POTENTIAL FINANCIAL STATEMENT IMPACTS BUT BELIEVES THE POTENTIAL EXPENDITURES TO COMPLY COULD BE MATERIAL.\\n\\nIN DECEMBER 2012, THE EPA ISSUED A FINAL RULE THAT SET A MORE STRINGENT ANNUAL AIR QUALITY STANDARD FOR FINE PARTICULATE MATTER. THE EPA\\n\\nISSUED FINAL ATTAINMENT/NONATTAINMENT DESIGNATIONS IN JANUARY 2015. UNTIL STATES DEVELOP THEIR IMPLEMENTATION PLANS, DOMINION CANNOT DETERMINE WHETHER OR HOW FACILITIES LOCATED IN AREAS DESIGNATED NONATTAINMENT FOR THE STANDARD WILL BE IMPACTED, BUT\\n\\nDOES NOT EXPECT SUCH IMPACTS TO BE MATERIAL.\\n\\nTHE EPA HAS FINALIZED RULES ESTABLISHING A NEW 1-HOUR NAAQS\\n\\nFOR NO\\n\\n2\\n\\nAND A NEW 1-HOUR NAAQS FOR SO\\n\\n2\\n\\n, WHICH COULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL NO\\n\\nX\\n\\nAND SO\\n\\n2\\n\\nCONTROLS IN CERTAIN AREAS\\n\\nWHERE DOMINION OPERATES. UNTIL THE STATES HAVE DEVELOPED IMPLEMENTATION PLANS FOR THESE STANDARDS, THE IMPACT ON DOMINION’S FACILITIES THAT EMIT NO\\n\\nX\\n\\nAND SO\\n\\n2\\n\\nIS UNCERTAIN. ADDITIONALLY, THE IMPACT OF PERMIT LIMITS FOR IMPLEMENTING NAAQS ON DOMINION’S FACILITIES IS UNCERTAIN\\n\\nAT THIS TIME.\\n\\nIN JUNE 2005, THE EPA FINALIZED AMENDMENTS TO THE REGIONAL HAZE RULE, ALSO KNOWN AS THE CLEAN AIR VISIBILITY\\n\\nRULE. THE RULE REQUIRES THE STATES TO IMPLEMENT BEST AVAILABLE RETROFIT TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENTS FOR SOURCES TO ADDRESS IMPACTS TO VISUAL AIR QUALITY THROUGH REGIONAL HAZE STATE IMPLEMENTATION PLANS, BUT ALLOWS OTHER ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS. DOMINION\\n\\nANTICIPATES THAT THE EMISSION REDUCTIONS ACHIEVED THROUGH COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER CAA-REQUIRED PROGRAMS WILL GENERALLY ADDRESS THIS RULE.\\n\\nIN DECEMBER 2015, THE EPA PUBLISHED A PROPOSED REVISION TO CSAPR. THE PROPOSAL SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCES THE CSAPR PHASE II OZONE SEASON NO\\n\\nX\\n\\nEMISSION CAPS IN 23 STATES INCLUDING VIRGINIA, WEST VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA, RELATIVE TO THE PHASE II CAPS UNDER THE\\n\\nCURRENT CSAPR RULE, THAT WOULD TAKE EFFECT BEGINNING WITH THE 2017 OZONE SEASON. THE PROPOSED REDUCTIONS IN STATE OZONE SEASON NO\\n\\nX\\n\\nCAPS WOULD IN TURN REDUCE, BY APPROXIMATELY 55% OVERALL, THE NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES DOMINION ELECTRIC GENERATING UNITS WILL\\n\\nRECEIVE UNDER THE CSAPR OZONE SEASON NO\\n\\nX\\n\\nPROGRAM BEGINNING\\n\\nWITH THE 2017 MAY - SEPTEMBER OZONE SEASON. IN ADDITION, THE EPA IS PROPOSING TO DISCOUNT THE USE OF BANKED PHASE I ALLOWANCES FOR COMPLIANCE IN PHASE II BY APPLYING EITHER A 2:1 OR 4:1 SURRENDER RATIO. UNTIL THE PROPOSAL IS FINALIZED, DOMINION IS\\n\\nUNABLE TO PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE IMPACT TO FUTURE CSAPR OZONE SEASON ALLOWANCE STREAMS AND TO WHAT EXTENT THE RULE MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CONTROLS. THE EPA EXPECTS TO ISSUE A FINAL REVISION TO CSAPR IN AUGUST 2016.\\n\\nIN APRIL 2014, THE PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ISSUED PROPOSED REGULATIONS TO REDUCE\\n\\nNO\\n\\nX\\n\\nAND VOC EMISSIONS FROM COMBUSTION SOURCES. THE\\n\\nREGULATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BE FINALIZED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2016. TO COMPLY WITH THE REGULATIONS, DOMINION GAS ANTICIPATES INSTALLING EMISSION CONTROL SYSTEMS ON EXISTING ENGINES AT SEVERAL COMPRESSOR STATIONS IN PENNSYLVANIA. UNTIL THE\\n\\nREGULATIONS ARE FINALIZED, DOMINION GAS CANNOT ESTIMATE THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND/OR CASH FLOWS RELATED TO THIS MATTER.\\n\\nCLIMATE CHANGE\\n\\nIN DECEMBER 2015, THE PARIS AGREEMENT WAS FORMALLY ADOPTED\\n\\nUNDER THE UNITED NATIONS FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE. THE ACCORD ESTABLISHES A UNIVERSAL FRAMEWORK FOR ADDRESSING GHG EMISSIONS INVOLVING ACTIONS BY ALL NATIONS THROUGH THE CONCEPT OF NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTIONS IN WHICH EACH\\n\\nNATION DEFINES THE GHG COMMITMENT IT CAN MAKE AND SETS IN PLACE A PROCESS FOR INCREASING THOSE COMMITMENTS EVERY FIVE YEARS. IT ALSO CONTAINS A GLOBAL GOAL OF HOLDING THE INCREASE IN THE GLOBAL AVERAGE TEMPERATURE TO WELL BELOW 2 DEGREES\\n\\nCELSIUS ABOVE PRE-INDUSTRIAL LEVELS AND TO PURSUE EFFORTS TO LIMIT THE TEMPERATURE INCREASE TO 1.5 DEGREES CELSIUS ABOVE PRE-INDUSTRIAL LEVELS AND TO AIM TO REACH GLOBAL PEAKING OF GHG EMISSIONS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.\\n\\nA KEY ELEMENT OF THE INITIAL U.S. NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTIONS OF ACHIEVING A 26% TO 28% REDUCTION BELOW 2005 LEVELS BY 2025 IS THE\\n\\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CLEAN POWER PLAN, WHICH ESTABLISHES INTERIM EMISSION REDUCTION TARGETS FOR FOSSIL FUEL-FIRED ELECTRIC GENERATING UNITS OVER THE PERIOD 2022 THROUGH\\n\\n55\\n\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\n\\n, CONTINUED\\n\\n2029 WITH FINAL TARGETS TO BE ACHIEVED BY 2030. THE EPA ESTIMATES THAT THE CLEAN POWER PLAN WILL RESULT IN A NATIONWIDE REDUCTION IN\\n\\nCO\\n\\n2\\n\\nEMISSIONS FROM FOSSIL FUEL-FIRED ELECTRIC GENERATING\\n\\nUNITS OF 32% FROM 2005 LEVELS BY 2030.\\n\\nDODD-FRANK ACT\\n\\nTHE DODD-FRANK ACT WAS ENACTED INTO LAW IN JULY 2010 IN AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE REGULATION OF FINANCIAL MARKETS. THE CEA, AS AMENDED BY TITLE VII OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT, REQUIRES CERTAIN OVER-THE COUNTER\\n\\nDERIVATIVES, OR SWAPS, TO BE CLEARED THROUGH A DERIVATIVES CLEARING ORGANIZATION AND, IF THE SWAP IS SUBJECT TO A CLEARING REQUIREMENT, TO BE EXECUTED ON A DESIGNATED CONTRACT MARKET OR SWAP EXECUTION FACILITY. NON-FINANCIAL ENTITIES THAT USE SWAPS\\n\\nTO HEDGE OR MITIGATE COMMERCIAL RISK, OFTEN REFERRED TO AS END USERS, MAY ELECT THE END-USER EXCEPTION TO THE CEA’S CLEARING REQUIREMENTS. DOMINION HAS ELECTED TO EXEMPT ITS SWAPS FROM THE CEA’S CLEARING REQUIREMENTS. THE CFTC MAY CONTINUE\\n\\nTO ADOPT FINAL RULES AND IMPLEMENT PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT THROUGH ITS ONGOING RULEMAKING PROCESS, INCLUDING RULES REGARDING MARGIN REQUIREMENTS FOR NON-CLEARED SWAPS. IF, AS A RESULT OF THE RULEMAKING PROCESS, DOMINION’S DERIVATIVE\\n\\nACTIVITIES ARE NOT EXEMPTED FROM CLEARING, EXCHANGE TRADING OR MARGIN REQUIREMENTS, IT COULD BE SUBJECT TO HIGHER COSTS DUE TO DECREASED MARKET LIQUIDITY OR INCREASED MARGIN PAYMENTS. IN ADDITION, DOMINION’S SWAP DEALER COUNTERPARTIES MAY\\n\\nATTEMPT TO PASS-THROUGH ADDITIONAL TRADING COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF, AND COMPLIANCE WITH, TITLE VII OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT. DUE TO THE ONGOING RULEMAKING PROCESS, DOMINION IS CURRENTLY UNABLE TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF\\n\\nTHE DODD-FRANK ACT’S DERIVATIVE-RELATED PROVISIONS ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.'"

balance sheet in   as we reduced our debt.  principal amount of total debt as of december     was       compared to  .    as of december    .  we intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period the primary factors that resulted in those changes and how certain accounting principles policies and estimates affect our financial statements.     critical accounting estimates  our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles u.s. gaap. the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to our revenue inventories goodwill impairments and income taxes. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with managements expectations the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.  management believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult subjective and complex judgments.  revenue recognition.  we recognize revenue upon the shipment of the product to our distributors sellin rather than upon the resale of the product by our distributors to their customers sellthrough. accordingly we have established provisions for rights of return and price protection on unsold product held by our distributors.  revenue allowances.  we record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales for estimated future price reductions and other customer incentives in the same period that the related revenues are recorded. we base these estimates on actual historical sales returns historical allowances historical price reductions market activity and other known or anticipated trends and factors. these estimates are subject to managements judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results.  inventory valuation.  at each balance sheet date we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence based on projected sales outlook. this evaluation includes analysis of historical sales levels by product and projections of future demand. these projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory. in addition we write off inventories that we consider obsolete. we adjust the remaining specific inventory balances to approximate the lower of our actual cost or estimated net realizable value. among other factors management considers recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand estimates of future selling prices competitiveness of product offerings market and industry conditions customer requirements and product life cycles when determining excess obsolescence and net realizable value in relation to the inventory on hand. if in any period we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates additional inventory writedowns may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. this would have a negative impact on our gross margin in that period. if in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written down in a previous period related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period.  goodwill.  we perform our goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred on a more frequent basis. the analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment.  qualitative factors include industry and market consideration overall financial performance share price trends and market capitalization and companyspecific events. we first analyze qualitative factors. if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount we do not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test.  if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value a quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. a quantitative impairment analysis if necessary considers the income approach which requires estimates of the present value of expected future cash flows to determine a reporting units fair value. significant estimates include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows discount rates and future economic and market conditions.  a goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting units fair value is less than its carrying value. any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.  income taxes  . in determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments. these estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes.     we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. unless recovery is considered morelikelythannot a probability level of more than   we will record a charge to income tax expense in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable or maintain the valuation allowance recorded in prior periods. in determining the need to establish or maintain a valuation allowance we consider multiple factors including past performance the reversal of deferred tax liabilities tax planning strategies and future expected taxable income. when considering all available evidence if it is determined we can morelikelythannot realize our deferred tax assets we will reverse the existing valuation allowance which would result in a credit to income tax expense and the establishment of an asset in the period of reversal.  in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the internal revenue service or other taxing authorities. if our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results an additional tax benefit or charge will result. we recognize the interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and income tax expense respectively.  results of operations  we report our financial performance based on the following two reportable segments the computing and graphics segment and the enterprise embedded and semicustom segment.  additional information on our reportable segments is contained in note   segment reporting of the notes to financial statements part ii item   of this form  .  our operating results tend to vary seasonally. historically our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends.  the following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income loss by segment for          and   .           in   net revenue.  computing and graphics           enterprise embedded and semicustom           total net revenue           operating income loss.  computing and graphics           enterprise embedded and semicustom           all other                 total operating income           computing and graphics  computing and graphics net revenue of   .    in     increased by      compared to   .    in      primarily as a result of a   increase in average selling price and a   increase in unit shipments. the increase in average selling price was primarily driven by a richer mix of client processors due to strong demand of our ryzen processors. the increase in unit shipments was primarily due to higher demand for our ryzen processors partially offset by lower demand for our radeon graphics products.  computing and graphics operating income was      in     compared to operating income of      in     . the increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher sales partially offset by a    increase in operating expenses. operating expenses increased for the reasons outlined under expenses below.  enterprise embedded and semicustom  enterprise embedded and semicustom net revenue of   .    in     decreased  by     compared to net revenue of   .    in      primarily as a result of lower semicustom product revenue partially offset by higher sales of our epyc server processors.  enterprise embedded and semicustom operating  income  was      in     compared to operating  income  of      in     . the increase in operating income was due primarily to higher sales of our epyc server processor and a licensing     gain of    recognized in the first quarter of   partially offset by lower semicustom product revenue and a    increase in operating expenses. operating expenses increased for the reasons outlined under expenses below.  all other  all other operating  loss  of      in     included      of stockbased compensation expense and a    contingent loss accrual on a legal matter.  all other operating  loss  of      in     included      of stockbased compensation expense and an impairment of technology licenses of    .  comparison of gross margin expenses licensing gain interest expense other expense and income taxes  the following is a summary of certain consolidated statement of

margin  gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was     in     compared to     in     . the improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by higher sales of ryzen and epyc processors which have a higher gross margin than the corporate average.  expenses  research and development expenses  research and development expenses of   .    in     increased  by       or      compared to   .    in     . the  increase  was primarily due to an increase in product development costs in both the computing and graphics and enterprise embedded and semicustom segments as well as an increase in stockbased compensation expense.  marketing general and administrative expenses  marketing general and administrative expenses of      in     increased  by       or      compared to      in     . the  increase  was primarily due to an increase in gotomarket activities in both the computing and graphics and enterprise embedded and semicustom segments as well as an increase in stockbased compensation expense.  licensing gain  during      we recognized      as licensing gain associated with the licensed ip to thatic jv. see note   of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.  interest expense  interest expense of      in     decreased  by      compared to      in      primarily due to lower debt balances.  other expense net  other  expense   net increased in     by      from net of  zero  in     . the change from     to     was primarily due to      of loss on redemption repurchases and conversions of debt in  .     provision for benefit from income taxes  we recorded an income tax provision of    in   and income tax benefit of    in  .  the income tax provision in     was primarily due to    of withholding taxes related to crossborder transactions and    of foreign income taxes in profitable locations partially offset by a    benefit for a reduction of u.s. income taxes accrued in the prior year.  the income tax benefit in     was primarily due to a    refund of withholding tax from a foreign jurisdiction related to a legal settlement from   offset by    of u.s. income taxes resulting from the tax reform act    tax provision in foreign locations and    of withholding taxes on crossborder transactions.  as we continue to make progress in our business resulting in improved financial results our future reassessment could possibly result in a determination that a valuation allowance is no longer required. the impact of the determination would result in the release of the valuation allowance and significant financial impact in a future reporting period with a material noncash income tax benefit and the recording of additional deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet.  international sales  international sales as a percentage of net revenue were     in     and     in     . we expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. substantially all of our sales transactions are denominated in u.s. dollars.  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources  as of  december       our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were   .    compared to   .    as of  december    .  the percentage of cash and cash equivalents held domestically was     as of  december       and     as of  december      . our operating investing and financing activities for fiscal          and     were as follows.           in   net cash provided by used in.  operating activities           investing activities                 financing activities

 respectively.  we believe our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balance along with our secured revolving facility entered into in june   refer to note   of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information will be sufficient to fund operations including capital expenditures over the next   months. we believe we will be able to access the capital markets should we require additional funds. however we cannot assure that such funds will be available on favorable terms or at all.  operating activities  net cash  provided by  operating activities was      in     compared to net cash  provided by  operating activities of      in     . the  increase  in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to changes in working capital largely driven by higher cash collections partially offset by timing of accounts payable payments and higher wafer purchases and payroll.  investing activities  net cash  used in  investing activities was      in   which primarily consisted of    for purchases of property and equipment partially offset by a net cash inflow from purchases and maturities of availableforsale debt securities of   .     net cash  used in  investing activities was      in   which primarily consisted of    for purchases of property and equipment and a net cash outflow from purchases and maturities of availableforsale debt securities of   .  financing activities  net cash  provided by  financing activities was      in   which primarily consisted of a cash inflow of    from the warrant exercised by west coast hitech l.p. wch and    from the issuance of common stock under our stockbased compensation equity plans partially offset by    of cash used for debt reduction activities during the year.  net cash  provided by  financing activities was      in   which consisted of a net cash inflow of    from the issuance of common stock through employee equity incentive plans partially offset by    of cash used for debt reduction activities in  .  contractual obligations  the following table summarizes our consolidated principal contractual cash obligations as of  december       and is supplemented by the discussion following the table.  payment due by period  in   total                   and  thereafter  term debt                   aggregate interest obligation                          other longterm liabilities

payable in cash for our outstanding debt.     amounts primarily represent future fixed and noncancellable cash payments associated with software technology and licenses and ip licenses including the payments due within the next   months.     represents purchase obligations for goods and services where payments are based in part on the volume or type of services we acquire. in those cases we only included the minimum volume of purchase obligations in the table above. purchase orders for goods and services that are cancellable upon notice and without significant penalties are not included in the amounts above.     total amount excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our consolidated balance sheets except for debt obligations and other liabilities related to software and technology licenses and ip licenses.  the expected timing of payments of the obligations in the preceding table is estimated based on current information. timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations.  term debt   .  senior notes due    on august     we issued    of the  .
